                        A bird died in my hands today. It was a small, helpless creature I found on the sidewalk walking my dog, a sidewalk I rarely ever walk him over.
                        I needed to take a detour, the original sidewalk meters ahead of me sporting a dogwalker who seemed all too comfortable with her world. Its feathers were 
                        brown-spotted, its breathing frantic, and its toes---I feel remise calling them talons---were splayed outwards. It looked paralyzed. Its beak was planted on the 
                        warm cement ground, hidden beneath the shade of the giant tree's canopy above us. Its body was arched upwards, like it had been trying so badly to lift itself
                        without success. I couldn't feel its warmth. If anything, the lingering heat surrounding us was the warmth I felt, yet this bird felt like nothing. It was helpless,
                        and I felt useless in my inability to heal anything. I stroked its spine, expecting the worse, hoping for the best. I asked it to fly, to find something to push it
                        forward but my words, English and indiscernible to their minds. I felt like a child again, in her dreams wishing for a better world. I don't know how the babe got 
                        in such a position to die, how something that flies and sings beneath the blue sky it calls home was struck down to this pitiful cement sidewalk. A granular sidewalk,
                        hard and unnerving to my bare flesh when I knelt down to comfort its last breath. My dog, a natural idiot, mistook it as food, the smell of death and rot and garbage 
                        parallel to his kibble dinner. That says a lot of the kibble dinner he eats. He held the bird in his mouth for just a second, less than one I'd hope, before I screamed
                        for him to drop it. It happened so quickly, his jaw snapping over the babe, his simultaneous release of it, and the bird's beak was wide and open, silently screaming, its 
                        bosom heaving even more than before. We're in a gentrified residential neighborhood and no one is around us on this Friday morning. It's alive, but I believe its hard gave out 
                        after witnessing the darkness of a giant's maw. I was furious at the attempt by my dog, its idiocy and canine senses colluding all too successfully. It died in my
                        hands, its breathing becoming smoother, slower, mute. Birds just like it sang around us. They flew past our faces and its black-beady eyes were still. It didn't feel right to leave it on
                        the sidewalk, a place where giants crush the worlds hidden between the cracks. So, I rested the babe in a flowerbed beside us, tried my best to close its eyes without damaging it 
                        anymore than my dog did, and left.

                        Yesterday was May Day, and I marched for Palestine in Baltimore. I didn't feel it necessary to cover myself, my tattoos and facade all exposed, though it was mostly because
                        I felt it unnecessary at this point. I'm already unemployed, my personal information has long been exposed by all avenues becauses of our big brother government,
                        and I feel like the need to "cover yourself" and your entirety, to abscond any edifice of your person, is a heavily predisposed by white privilege. It is white people
                        who ultimately have the choice to hide their beliefs and what they wear to discern their ideals. I can't do that. I'm already brown-skinned, opinionated, trans,
                        fat. I have discernible features already, unlike most white people who are quite similar in taste and physicality. My comrade, of who she prefers to be unnamed (a pattern, you'll see),
                        is of the demographic who identifies with the marginalized yet her white skin trumps over any sort of marginalization. White skin is one's prime safety. She 
                        participated in the march fully covered, her keffiyeh wrapped around her skull so only her eyes showed bits of excitement or draw. She pointed out my self-exposure. I 
                        told her she looks like every white person currently within the march. She wasn't the most in danger, Palestinians and people of color were. Yet, she felt the need 
                        to hide her visage as much as possible. She has no tattoos, no discernible features, and is blonde with rich parents. There is a pattern, you see, in the psyche of the 
                        privilege. Give them the flavor of oppression, and they see themselves as the ultimate martyrs.

            <h3 class="one">An Opine to Set the Air </h3>
            <h4 class="one">Thursday, May 1, 2025</h4>
            <p class="two">
                It took me the few several months I have been in Baltimore to realize I can
                write about my thoughts into the endless virtual void rather than ponder on them
                in my own cerebrum to the point of insanity. I have been unemployed, say, since January, since
                moving here, and it's been an interesting venture of nearly hundreds of applications
                to writing, communication, and legal jobs. There came this bleak realization,
                of which my partner rightfully tries to dismay me from, that because of my name, my gender,
                and my skin color, the probability of my finding work in the same relative spaces I used
                to work in Florida are likely quite low. In other words, being a Muslim, brown-skinned trans woman
                once again has its disadvantages, though such disadvantages never seemed to have disappeared ever, admittedly.
            </p>
            <p class="two">
                Still, writing becomes a salvation for my wellbeing once more, as it always has
                years before and now. I find myself deeper in the words I write, sinking into the digital ink over my
                laptop and questioning where such creativities have been hiding for so long. Yet within all of this
                neverending career searching and literary absolution, I have never been happier. Not contributing
                to the autocratic, oligarchic capitalist, racist, transphobic, xenophobic, genocidal oil-machine that is America and the American
                non-communal workforce has had its benefits to my emotional and mental psyche, but I must 
                emphasize the exponential importance and privilege that is of my moving from Florida to Baltimore. This place 
                is nothing like the Florida I was forced to exist in. For those who do not know, Florida, in its entirety, is inherently racist 
                and queerphobic. Some may argue with me, but the placation of one's white or pale skin holds massive benefits in such a place, like many around the world,
                and such a benefit is something I never had. I was called "white-passing" at one point, but such a phrase is ultimately
                relative, as not once was I ever recognized as "white" by those I'd have preferred to be seen as such: bigots and racists.
            </p>
            <p class="two">
                Baltimore has given me a sense of home and friends, two gravitous things that hold such value
                to the typical person. I've found identity not only in my transness, but through my Latinx and Arab-Indian
                identity. I see people who look like me, talk like me, have the same mannerisms of my aunties, mamaji, bapaji, uncles
                who all immigrated to Canada from India and the Middle East. Although, with all of these happy happenings,
                there were hardships along this journey. There were friends I still love who no longer are in my life,
                who wish to never see any image of me whatsoever. There are family members that are now strangers.
                Transition---whether it may be of one's gender or identity or of one location to another---is a heavy and restless journey.
                It is a realization that things and people are ultimately temporary. I think that's why I hold on so much to those
                I love, especially to those who will never love me again. There is temporance to life, and we must each
                use such limited time to care for another, regardless of the cracks between their bridges.
            </p>
            <p class="two">
                That's why I hold so strongly to the quote "Apathy is death". While my memory holds onto it
                from a video game, the phrase itself is deeply inspiring. To be apathetic is to kill oneself. It is to
                lose the one thing that keeps us parallel to the purity of other species. We humans are not the prime species. We are 
                violent, oppressive constructs. We aren't positively "separated" from natural things because of our sentience, rather our
                sentience is what maintains our savagery. Refuse apathy, I say, and love one another, even those who wish to
                never love you again. It is with that we break ourselves from the capitalist molds the authority has wanted us to believe for so long.
            </p>
