                A lot from this trip inspired the creative prose I was able to write for this assignment. 
                Poland, specifically, taught me perspective. 
                It showed me of a world brazed by history, built upon decisions upon decisions, all to make it what it is now. 
                Auschwitz is wildly definitive in that it produced a surrounding horror for me. 
                We were pulled into what seemed like a different world outside of time yet highly reflective of our own time. 
                Here was a place, a momentous occurrence of murders, subjugation, slavery, chemical experimentation, 
                and the dehumanization efforts by an ethno-supremacist state calling themselves 
                the righteous mortal men of the human world all for the sake of their beliefs and what 
                they believe is deserved upon those deemed meek and less than human. Such a history is truth now, still. 

            </p>

            <p class="two">

                The George Santayana quote inked on the wall in one of the torture buildings told us, 
                “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it”. Yet, we do remember the past. 
                We remember the artifice of a past, really, of a version told to us of crazed sociopaths versus 
                the meek being saved by the vigilant allies. Although, if that was such a case, why did the 
                world—specifically America—allow the Jewish people to be exterminated and genocided and 
                holocausted by the Nazis since 1930? One could argue such a spread of the truth and information 
                was different given the inability to spread such information in such quick manners <a href="https://artsci.tamu.edu/news/2022/10/holocaust-comparisons-are-
                frequent-in-us-politics-and-reflect-a-shallow-understanding-of-the-actual-genocide-
                and-the-us-response.html">(Seipp, 2022)</a>. 
                Regardless, if, during that time, the Jewish people were truly seen as the oppressed, did the 
                world not have a responsibility to save their fellow human from another fellow human? Why, 
                then, we must ask ourselves, is history repeating itself? I think, in this context, to allow one 
                to kill a human, another human in mass quantities, you must not think of this being as human. 
                You must be taught they are less than, a fraction, subhuman, really. And by slowly learning they 
                are subhuman by the Nazi propaganda, a propaganda deemed art and truth by certain German nationalists and 
                international people, you believe in it yourself because it’s a majority thought. In this context, 
                the Nazis were the infamous heroes fighting, on equal fronts, the projected animals of the Jewish people 
                who invaded their territories. When this is their relative modernity, of course you can repeat history 
                many times. So, what this trip taught me was the portent of selectivity, of who deserves to be saved and 
                who doesn’t, because as long as we believe a human being is not a human being, you can do anything to them 
                as long as they are seen as pulled flesh and muscle cooked over a spit and served on a platter and deemed 
                as “food”. It taught me that there is such a thing as dehumanization in other parts of the world, still, 
                by white faces who see other white faces as more human than others.

            </p>

                This trip angered me, admittedly. It projected one deserving liberation against another undeserving 
                liberation. Russia has been an enemy of America for decades, and, naturally, America will use every 
                avenue to ensure the masses hate Russia because the more we hate others and are blinded by the fury 
                of what deserves to die, the American power allows us to forget what it itself has been doing for decades 
                and centuries since its very conception. America genocided indigenous peoples. America genocided Africans 
                in the name of slavery. America watched Jewish people be holocausted by Nazis because it didn’t affect them 
                until Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941, and Nazi Germany and fascist Italy declared war 
                <a href="https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/path-pearl-harbor">(Michal, 2017)</a>. 
                America allowed the Vietnamese people to be destroyed because they wanted to no longer be dominated. America, 
                for decades, taught us to hate the Arabic face because the Muslim faith is more real and loving than the 
                Evangelical Christian domination it teaches us. America kills transgender people of color, black and brown 
                and Arabic and African faces; it blackbags brown immigrants because it legitimized hatred of black and brown 
                immigrants. America experimented on black and brown bodies to the point of sterilization because if the 
                black and brown body can reproduce, then “the white man is lost”. All these matters could only occur by 
                the construction of dehumanizing a people and the normalization of apathy. Legally, I do not exist; I, a 
                transgender Indo-Persian-Ecuadorian woman of brown skin in America, does not exist as a woman and therefore, 
                if I dissent for too long, can be disappeared quite easily <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/

            </p>

            <p class="two">

                Yet that is the issue of who deserves to survive and who doesn’t. The Ukrainian people are being killed 
                by Russia, and America is the ally of Ukraine because America has always despised Russia as a potential 
                superpower in equivalency <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/3/8/why-do-they-hate-russia">(Golstein, 2014)</a>. 
                America wishes to be the retaining dominant force, so, 
                naturally, it sees allying itself with Ukraine as a smart choice, not because the American government is at 
                all benevolent. America sends weapons to its proxies, to Egypt to survey Africa, to Taiwan to survey 
                China <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9265/">(Curtis, 2023)</a>, 
                to Israel to survey the Arabic people <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2025/6/18/the-history-of-

                all for the sake of control. I struggle to not be enraged by the selective outrage on this trip. The anger 
                of Ukraine being attack by Russia, the anger of Hamas attacking Israel on October 7, even though Israel 
                executed the Hannibal Directive to have a publicized reason to livestream a genocide on the Palestinian 
                people (<a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-07-07/ty-article-magazine/.premium/idf-ordered-hannibal-
                directive-on-october-7-to-prevent-hamas-taking-soldiers-captive/00000190-89a2-d776-a3b1-fdbe45520000">
                Kubovich, 2024</a>; <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/9/why-did-israel-deploy-hannibal-directive-
                allowing-killing-of-own-citizens">“Why Did Israel Deploy Hannibal Directive”, 2024</a>). When it is brown and black faces 
                being genocided by the very same governments upheld by white cis men, many go silent. They say it doesn’t 
                involve them. Their omission and apathy say these people are not people, and they deserve to die or are 
                labeled terrorists or invaders by those proclaiming themselves as using self-defense 
                <a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/deceiving-the-public">(“Deceiving the Public”, n.d.)</a>. 
                They say what the American government has so long been trying to 
                propagandize for decades. And I’m expected to be silent about it? Until decades later when the same 
                self-proclaimed liberal voice feigns their new empathy for another destroyed culture?

            </p>

            <p class="two">

                The ethno-supremacist state of Israel who harbinges on their actions as Jewish actions vilifies 
                Jewish faith and faces rather than the proxy government that uses these people for genocidal reasons, 
                “Israel's conduct seems to be stimulating open hostility to Jews around the world, as local targets for 
                anger at Gaza's agony” <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/israeli-policies-in-gaza-endanger-jews">(Solomon, 2023)</a>. 
                America hates those who support Palestine, calling them terrorists 
                and defilers of the free nation, arresting them and beating them with their police, yet never do they 
                actually take any action on the cultists of the Ku Klux Klan, the vagrant Neo-Nazis that roam our streets 
                with the protection of police forces, the very same people who spew true antisemitism, anti-Muslim 
                terrorism, anti-black, anti-trans, anti-queer, anti- anything that isn’t white, cis, and heterosexual 
                in the name of “Manifest Destiny”, unless it allows them to play their game of pretend 
                (<a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/08/14/543477490/racism-is-evil-trump-denounces-the-kkk-neo-nazis-and-white-supremacists">Bennett, 2017</a>; 
                <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/26/neo-nazis-trump-extremism">Makuch, 2025</a>). 
                I ask this as a rhetorical because I know a version of the answer, 
                but why is that, one must ask themselves. America sees itself as immortal, yet that which cheats death 
                must have little respect for life.

        <h3 class="one">Apathy I</h2>
        <h4 class="one">Sunday, August 10, 2025</h3>

        <div>

            <p class="two">
                
                In these passing days I witnessed apathy, again, by those I expected to have been apathetic yet wished otherwise. 
                There are two friends, one named Dee, the other Eye, and they indirectly pronounced their apathy.
                Dee and I were doing our long-awaited writing session that, usually, occurs every Saturday at our nearby cafe, 
                and he was expressing his distaste for a comic book writer who was alleged to have commit sexual assault while 
                simultaneously creating an incredible comic series named "The Sandman". He rightfully announced his 
                lost desire to consume any of the writer's material going forward, similarly to J.K. Rowling's transphobic rhetoric, 
                and, as conversation goes, we moved to a different topic: his father enrolling him into golf as a teenager. 

            </p>

            <p class="two">

                I was, admittedly, slightly surprised by Dee's enrollment in the sport of the white, usually conservative, aristrocrat, though 
                I failed to remember the integrated tokenization of black men to make such a sport seem elevatingly diverse. 
                Given our friendship since our first fiction workshop together back in Fall of 2024, we have been communicating here and there, 
                experimenting our writing with another merely by presence, and so I decided to share my opinions of the inherently racist and aristrocatic sport
                named "golf". He told me, and I am paraphrasing, he played the sport as a reluctant participant, solely doing it because 
                his dad could afford such a thing and wanted his college admissions to impress such an act. Such a thing was understandable. 
                We then brought our session to a close and began to walk out, and I shared with him about the comforts of golf and the 
                illusion it begets for those wishing to be amongst greenery that is merely vanity---golf, I am speaking of---and comparing 
                it to our locale of Fells Point, a place of deceptively similar value: vanity. I pointed to the tourists walking the 
                promenade, white folk wearing red, white, and blue clothing, prancing around with joy amongst one another, the white and black 
                bourgeoise walking past immigrant and black workers who empty and replace the city trash to provide the sense of comfort for 
                one and discomfort for another. I was trying, in other words, to be critical of capitalism. Dee surprised me when he said,
                and, again, I am paraphrasing, "I don't know. I like having money to be able to buy anything I want, to have a nice apartment 
                in Fells Point, and to not have to worry about anything". He told me this with a stern, strained face, a face that reflected 
                an annoyance of something smaller, perceivably, than them. I was shocked by the statement. He made this statement after 
                I supplemented my criticism of the folk on the promenade by contrasting their presence to the genocide of the Palestinians, 
                to the blatant transphobic and racist regulations of the American government. Dee is capable of being outraged, yes, 
                but, like many liberals and liberal zionists, outrage can most definitely be selective. Apathy is such a precursor. 

            </p>

            <p class="two">

                The phrase <i>If I am not directly affected, then I am safe</i> is one that exists in many translations yet whose 
                meaning stays quite the same. My second companion will be named Eye, and just this past Friday we had two 
                separate conversations: the first was at our workplace where he mentioned a white woman asking him why he 
                was not protesting for Palestine and his response being "It's not my fight", and the second at the mid-point of 
                our group bike ride where the topic of conversation was his romantic life. Now, let me begin by reflecting 
                the first conversation: Eye is a black man, over six-foot, toned, a vegan, a debonair for astrology and yoga, 
                and very much into riding bikes. The woman in question was somebody we both have a distaste for: someone who 
                feels compelled to congratulate a minority for being a minority and being vocal about being a minority. She is 
                a lesbian, too, though, like many white-skinned, caucasian people who fall into a minority subclass, she feels 
                more persecuted in her existence because of her queerness. For those who understand, this is just not the case: 
                the black-skinned lesbian woman will always be more oppressed and subjugated because it is her skin colour that defines 
                such a thing. The example is translatory. 

            </p>

            <p class="two">

                I admit I failed to educate Eye in that moment. I should have been vocal about the plight of the Palestinians is 
                relative to his plight as a straight black man---yes, even if he is straight---because oppression is ultimately 
                classist AND racist, they are rarely separate, and him working in a Whole Foods being forced to work more than forty-hours 
                a week is the minute and fractionalized example of his similarity to the plight of the Palestinians and their genocide 
                to his own life. Eye, in my understanding, was more frustrated by a white lesbian woman telling him what and who he 
                should defend and, understandably so, it causes one to feel commanded. Let us remember that it is the white skin of 
                Europeans who have caused all the oppression and violence towards people of color. Let us remember that it was not the 
                Palestinians who holocausted the Jews but white skinned German Nazi nationalists who still exist in perpetuity today in 
                both America and the Western Civilization. Let us remember that the same policemen who corral and arrest student 
                protestors for calling the genocide of the Palestinians a genocide are the same policemen who supported the 
                officer(s) who murdered George Floyd, the same policemen who corraled and beat the Black Lives Matters protestors. 
                Let us remember black children, men, and women are still being killed every day of every hour, many by police, 
                and yet nothing is done not being of the action of protests and the necessary conflict it created but by the upended silence 
                and inaction that has been bestowed onto the masses' belief that "nothing can be changed" and "it's just not my fight".

            </p>

            <p class="two">

                Eye's interpretation of Palestine not being his fight is not his fault. He has been told by the same black bourgeoise that 
                to maintain peace is to not entertain conflict. A black face in power is rarely your friend, and there have been 
                many examples of such men who spew the same rhetoric of apathy and omission from conflict. Think of Cornell West or Bakari Sellers.
                I think the argument of "Palestine not being my fight" is one that is bred from one's own trauma. It is of one 
                never feeling truly heard or cared for, of one feeling forced to exist under a certain spectrum, of one hoping that, one day, 
                all their apathy and omission will amount to something. Something! We don't know what it is, but they, those who tell us to be apathetic, 
                tell us it is something. I wonder, still, if I were to have asked Eye, "Do you believe only black people should 
                have protested for Black Lives?" if he would have the same path of thoughts as he does with Palestine. The liberation for one 
                begets the liberation for all, my friends. We are curing a diseased world, and inaction is but a bandaid over a severed leg.

                Atrophy is relative. To the bloodmisted Palestinian child, mother, and father in Gaza, the West Bank, and all 
                of Palestine, I am wildly energetic and full of stupor. Beside my best friend, I feel like a shell of sullen bone, 
                of the weakest organism bred by man and woman and person. I sometimes wonder what life would be like if I weren't 
                alive. Such a brilliant paradox. What would life be like if any of us weren't alive? Who would govern nature? 
                Who would enact wars on the other? Both require dominance and facets of control, truly. Yet, the natural order of things, 
                not in the sense of hegemonic dominion but true natural order, the natural symbiosis of life itself, is inherently 
                pure and benevolent to the other. What I mean to say is, are we not here, alive, to benefit each other rather than oneself?
                But then this begs the question of the antithesis, the ultimate balance of the arithmetic of life: for where is the malevolent?

                Discourse is a natural form of the evolutionary mind. I beg to disagree it acting conclusive to that of the body, though. 
                When I think of discussion, I think of a communal action in pursuit of growth. Yet, when such a mask of the mind 
                yearns to control through its discourse, then the evolution turns stagnant. In other words, the man that yields 
                to not his own didactic revelation but of the perceived lesser's flayed vulnerability does not wish to evolve others 
                in mind but devolve such things for the whims of a more laborious body.

                where a white man looks at me and asks me, "You look like that terrorist on TV," as he reaches his porkish hands towards his

                My trip to Europe---to Krakow, Poland---spoiled me, I think. I witnessed a people 
                who had perfected people-dependency from cars, a people who maximized safety by reducing 
                the need for rubber automatons and instead replaced such things with bipedal motion, 
                a people where there was never a need for a Pride month because discrimination against those who 
                were considered different or subversive or transgressive to the politics of their government was never 
                a major goal or streamline. Seriously. Pop into Krakow, and every single millenial you'll encounter 
                dresses like a non-binary, genderfluid androgynous model who is genuinely happy about life and being 
                surrounded by people because it's how they grew up. They were never subjected to the Americanism of life. The 
                constant dredge of work and "efficiency" of killing yourself to ensure the tip of the corporate pyramid 
                makes another six-digit paycheck for the workday. 
            </p>

            <p class="two">
                And this is why I've decided to rant once again into this perpetual void that only my reflection ever reads.
                Hopefully. Goodness am I mad. I forget how hateful people can still be in America. It left my mind for so long 
                that people still make time in their rotted hearts to spit into the face of folks they deem lesser than. 
                Folks make time to be transphobic in the most arduous of spaces, such as a Whole Foods cashier line, while 
                supporting a genocidal entity, such as Amazon, to shout obscenities at the cashier of her cashier line because, 
                well, the cashier is incapable of meeting the customer's demands, so the customer releases themselves from the 
                mottled censor they attached themselves to and lose all decorum all for the sake of making themselves feel on 
                top of the world. I shouldn't be surprised. Of course a vassal supporter of the genocide on Palestine 
                is transphobic. God, how could I forget. I have too much faith in people, people who tell themselves they are 
                good people, still, as long as they don't directly show how much they hate those who are different from them, 
                whether they are making less than a one-percent fraction of their annual salary at the Whole Foods cashier line or 
                are being bombed and burned alive in Palestine by the Israeli Occupation Forces. It's all the same to them. 
                It's the streamlined "hate" that they've ridden on for so long, that spitting on the face at the 
                transgender cashier at your Whole Foods cashier line and cheering when immigrants are being headbagged and deported by 
                America's ICE-Gestapo and Palestinians are being obliterated and their land prepared to be sold for 
                American real-estate. It doesn't even matter if they're a customer, really. Even another employee within the same 
                store will find a way to belittle you all for the sake of self-determination. I want to go back to Krakow, to a 
                place like Krakow, where my identity isn't seen as different or moving past boundaries of fashion and gender identity. 
                No matter how much I hide myself in the shadows, lock myself up in the iron box I stay in, these people still 
                find the time out of their day to just be horrible. Just why? What does it do for you? I am so curious as to 
                the psychological cogs that are smoking when they turn when you've succeeded in berating your fellow human. I want to 
                see how the cobwebs are being ripped apart when you believe in your success in self-evolution. I want to go home 
                somewhere far from this place, this place that, for years, has told me I deserve to die. Whether it be my 
                skin color, my religion, or my gender, this place has always told me I deserve to die. What do I do?

                I have picked myself apart in so many ways through so many years that I've relied on the 
                dodginess of expired metaphysical, metaphorical glue to keep me intact. This volatile connection 
                holds together pieces of people keeping my blurred reflection a somewhat familiar presence. Yet, 
                what do I do when these remembrances clustered in this leaking crevice of a mind leave me? I struggle to remember who I was. 
                Is there a person behind these memories who so badly wish to stay alive? Do not answer that, please.

                I will be flying to Krakow, Poland soon for a writer's residency within my Master's program. It will be 
                the first time I fly alone, to a place without family or friends at its destination, meeting entirely new 
                people under solitary circumstances. One of the pieces we are meant to read is Milan Kundera's 
                "The Book of Laughter and Forgetting", and a statement from the novel I find myself blazingly incapable of 
                forgetting myself is: "It is 1971, and Mirek says that the struggle of man against power 
                is the struggle of memory against forgetting" (3). It's just the first page, so the supplemented reading 
                comprehension is all too amateur, though the quotation vexes me nonetheless. Why do we as people forget so easily?
                This is a rhetoric, you see, because do we truly forget so easily? I remember exactly what I was wearing on a 
                cold 2018 summer-spring evening outside of a Starbucks on Walsingham Blvd around the corner from my mother's house 
                on 137th St. N in Largo, FL: a thrifted, over-sized pale green cotton sweater with khaki shorts that need two washes, 
                blue underpants with a hole in the crotch, and some type of shoe, skate shoes, maybe, likely. I lied about the exactly. 
                That's okay. Lying and forgetting are deceptively similar. 

             </p>

             <p class="two">

                Yet this example of being an entirely useless, expectedly forgettable night is a lie, too. This was the night 
                an old friend of mine tried, for one of the first of many, to stop me from committing suicide. He did not know 
                I wanted to commit suicide, but his actions, however consistent and cosmically necessary, prohibited me from 
                doing so not because of his words and aches and pleads but rather his presence. It was his existence and 
                proximity that allowed me to forget the troubles of the past, the great sins of life itself, and reminded me there 
                was a reason to exist: love. This old friend who will remain unnamed for some time, if not forever, told me the 
                reason he kept being consistent in his attempts to bring me back to life was because he saw me as someone he could 
                relate to more than any other. I did not know if I were to feel sorry for him for sharing my likeness or 
                affirmed for being seen by my closest companion. And here returns Kundera's quote, of the arduous and profane 
                existence of what is and isn't forgetting that actuates the power of human. I wish to forget this event. I wish to 
                forget him entirely. Because if I could forget him and all he had done for me, I would be able to fictionalize a 
                villain from his visage. It is 2025, and my struggle as a trans woman against power is the struggle of memory 
                against forgetting. I cannot seem to forget this man. Just the memory of him impedes me. One of the last things 
                he told me was, "nobody needs someone". Something like that. 

             </p>

             <p class="two">

                This trip to Poland, I hope, will be an experience from reality. It will be a test of the self, of the individual. 
                For so long I wondered if a single human being could truly enact their life solely alone and in solitude, and as such 
                I was reminded of the burden of the artist, specifically the confined writer in their own thoughts. Yet, 
                such a concept that is "individualism" is one bred by capitalism, of the hierarchical classist ideologies 
                we are taught since our inception to climb the bleeding faces of those we deem "beneath" us all to rise to this 
                glass ceiling that is never meant to be moved through, just seen, as those in true power have made such an edifice of their 
                position as such by the very confounding principles they taught us to believe. Their very aptitude is dependent on our 
                unkindly ineptitude of empathy. Authoritarianism, fascism, totalitarianism are each dependent on the majority civilian population's 
                apathetic responses to a socially constructed ethnically minority populace. Such apathy is dependent on the art of forgetting. 
                Those who deem to call themselves "the power" abolish historical resources that keep us in a constant state of reminding that we 
                mustn't repeat such atrocities from the past as to never endow such fates onto another oppressed peoples ever again for the sake 
                of unification. Yet unification deconstructs the illusion of disarray. When a people are unified, there is no 
                veil of war to separate us. The ideologue of war is a fabrication. War is innately totalitarian. It is 
                a form of control. It is a weapon of disconnection, of the individualist's ideal sense of worth. "If I am not being 
                hunted, then I am safe because I am worthy of life". The placation of war and genocide is a placation of classism, that 
                the subject who is the victim or target of war or genocide is deserving of said genocide or war because a human that is 
                undeserving of genocide of war would not be at war, according to the individualist, according to the apathetic. It is an 
                ultimate irony given by the very powers that control our very subjugation who never seem to participate in their own fabrications of war. 
                They fire remote-controlled drones from their golden palaces in the comfort of their air con, watching dehumanized digital faces, 
                usually brown or black, be eviscerated in seconds from an experimented missile bomb that was initially tested on 
                rural black or black populaces until its perfection to then be used on its own people. 
             </p>

             <p class="two">

                Here lies the pleasure of forgetting. It could be construed as a blessing to forget such atrocities committed 
                by those of power. It could be a haven for those wishing to rid themselves of such realities. Admittedly, 
                I am one of those people. How peaceful it would be to discover such bliss upon forgetting. Powers be damned, 
                but feel free to wrap those iron links around my bodice for the sake of illusory liberation. Alas, it is the 
                art of remembering that keeps some of us in our fleeting state of humanity. It is the very reminder that we 
                cannot forget such things, such harrowing memories of <i>being</i> that allow us to push forward through the 
                metaphorical torrents of life. I must admit, too: I never wish to forget my old friend. His physical presence, 
                forever distanced from mine, for reasons of my own wrongdoings, still finds itself in those retained memories 
                within my cerebrum. And those, for however long I am blessed with memory, I wish to maintain forevermore.

                Many things have happened this past week. I struggle to comprehend them all, admittedly, as so much occurs 
                in such sporadic, short times, that it feels like fiction. The Madleen and the volunteers being abducted by the 
                Israeli Occupation Force in international waters, breaking international law, torturing three of the remaining 
                volunteers of twelve in whatever tormented prison they've designed for thousands of innocent

                    said torturing maintaining because the IOF attacked Iran for no literal reason nor probable cause, 
                calling it a "preemptive strike"---in others words, "unprovoked"---thus committing blatant terrorism, yet the Western 
                Media refuses to do such a thing and instead has used Iran's rightful retaliation, following Israel's entire 
                propaganda scheme of "having the right to defend itself" (though in this case it is in Iran's right), to throw 
                blame onto Iran, and Israel marketing themselves as the victim in this charade</a>. <a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/least-60-palestinians-killed-israel-while-seeking-aid-gaza" target="_blank">
                    This comes during then after 
                Israel's blackout on Gaza after destroying Gaza's last satelite hub for internet use, furthering their genocide on 
                a population of mostly orphaned children, starving and dying by the minute</a>, and attacking Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Yemen,
                too, in their complete and total terroristic annihilation of brown-skinned countries (including Sudan and Congo, though the news on these countries is little to none given how easily misdirected we have become). 
                But it doesn't end there. Because 
                of the American majority and their complicity in silence of the genocide---the normalization of murder and soulless acts 
                in defiling human freedom---<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2025/3/26/members-of-us-congress-demand-the-release-of-activist-mahmoud-khalil" target="_blank">
                    then turning to allowing citizens advocating for Palestine to be deported</a>, to then translate 
                into migrants to be deported, taken, and disappeared, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/7/ice-operating-in-la-for-2nd-day-amid-protests-against-immigration-raids" target="_blank">

                brown and black faces from colonized countries seeking refuge in the 
                supposed country of refuge, though most understand such a pact was only meant for immigrants of white skin</a>(and Western Media has
                 not hesitated in using this time as a means to re-humanize themselves in their complicity and silence in Palestine's ongoing genocide by Israel). Israel, the IOF,
                understands it is losing. So, they knowingly attack a country that is capable of defending itself, an entity that isn't 
                a starving infant (since this seems to be Israel's main casualty in their genocide), and, knowingly, anticipates Iran's defense 
                to retaliate onto Israel's terroristic headquarters that are embedded within civilian populations.

                Today was 
                the polite protesting of the "No Kings" national rally. My goodness. My bloody god. It was everything I expected. 
                The democrats are such a cowardly, lazy tribe. They believe they do the utmost when committing the bare minimum and expected 
                medium from the appropriate parties of this government. They say what is safe: "Fuck Trump". They speak of the obvious:
                "He's deporting immigrants". They do nothing that obfuscates domination---protesting on the sidewalk, within confines, 
                and organizing such a thing as if it's a sorry reflection of a parade, with booths and food trucks and non-reluctant senators. 
                It baffles me, really. Such people refuse to accept the layers that have built up such a modernity. They refute the 
                topic of Israel's genocide on Palestine, acting as if such an occurrence and the American complicity had not led to 
                such a thing as the Gestapo's ICE raids on innocent peoples. They pretend as if polite, quiet protesting is actual dissent. 
                There is no dissent against the authority with these "peaceful" protests. Peaceful protesting lost value decades ago when 
                the police and government realized how easy it is to continue doing their own crimes when the people believe such a method 
                of protesting accomplishes anything. If order is never pushed into disarray, then all continues. It's lazy. Telling each other Trump
                is a fascist is cowardly. Telling each other he's doing "bad things" against immigrants is selective outrage. Speaking and 
                admitting that he and the American government themselves, regardless of either side of the coin, have been actively 
                contributing to a genocide, actively using American taxes to fund weapons of mass destruction to an apartheid state onto an 
                occupied population while we suffer from lack of healthcare, lack of free education, and our own subjugation through 
                the dissolution of transgender rights, racism, xenophobia, while the entirety of Israel uses the facade of "antisemitism" 
                to continue to terrorize Palestine, all while their entire occupation exists, through America, with free healthcare, free 
                education, free weapons and bombs, as long as they exist under a legalized race, ethnicity, and religious superiority. I am frustrated 
                to see many people denouncing proclamations for Palestine's freedom after almost two years of this livestream genocide. There should be no excuse for the silence.
                I am frustrated to hear Trump as a character being 
                denounced, yet the government he is a part of and contributing to be held, still, with a moral regard. The moment the 
                American populace rips apart the very flesh behind the visage that is Trump and sees what lies beneath the rot is the 
                day it has already ended. The day Palestine becomes free. The day their silence and our provocation becomes their own slice 
                of activism, their belief that they have been apart of this fight all along.

                <p class="two">
                
                A few weeks ago, my new neighbor's friend who 
                helped him move his items into his new home approached my partner and I at our door. We had flyers on our windows 
                inquiring for roommates at our home, and the flyers had the appropriate socialist symbols: the trans flag, 
                Palestine, Karl Marx, the Doom Slayer---your typical ideologues. Our caption mentioned a prioritization for transgender folks 
                of color. He told us, "I love all that's on there: Palestine, trans flag, all that stuff" then proceeds to say, "But, ya 
                see, I'm a civil rights lawyer-" this is a white, supposedly gay, man with beige shorts above the knees and a flowery pink button-up, "And 
                I'm worried a conservative will see this, apply for your rental, be denied because they're not trans, and sue you and take this to the Supreme Court and 
                take away transgender rights even more."

                </p>

                <p class="two">

                    I was flabbergasted. And confused. My rights have already been taken, and you're worried about 
                    this hypothetical you've concocted to remove even more from my livelihood? This is what you think the conversatives will care about? 
                    Conservatives are on their boats listening to the next up-and-coming country rock singer right now. They do not give a single 
                    shit about what my flyer is saying. Literally nobody does. I would have roommates by now if that were the case. 
                    Every "right" I had is gone now, and such a thing is true 
                    because the American people have normalized destroying people, murdering people, obliterating an entire culture to the point that 
                    destroying the legal existence of a trans person was nothing but an ordinary Tuesday for the government. Gods, I wish I screamed at this 
                    man. I wish I roared at his idiocy. This is what you're worrying about? Trans peoples' rights as you speak to a brown Muslim trans woman who is very well 
                    educated on the topic of trans people losing all their rights? 
                    This is the type of person that shows up to a "No Kings" rally. "I like your message, but right now isn't the time". It's never 
                    the right time for you people. You privileged bastards. Pale skinned. 10000-thread egyptian cotton shirts and Gucci boater shoes. 
                    Vanity is all you strive for, isn't it? The proposition of progress rather than the enactment of it. There is a reason we are told to not 
                    show anger by our oppressors. Emotion is action, as they say. Apathy is inaction. And inaction is death.

            <p class="two">

                Zionists, Christian Evangelicals, racists, transphobes, xenophobes, self-proclaimed "True Americans" have construed 
                an argument for this Pride and many other Prides not occurring within
                white-majority regions with a single rhetoric: "Where is Pride in Palestine?" 
                
            </p>

            <p class="two">
                
                It's a rhetoric based on relying on 
                one's delusion, on one's misinformation of colonization and the white man's many murders of indigenous peoples' lands. Pride 
                has become whitewashed over these decades, as does the white liberal man and woman towards
                all non-white acts of identity, the revolutionary entirety misconstrued into the individualist's 
                party outing. 
                
            </p>

            <p class="two">
                
                What once belonged to a black face or a brown face now becomes a white person's monopoly.

                white copycats that seemingly repeat through each decade with a new theft of culture not belonging to themselves, 
                then becomes the white man's property not by truth and tradition but literal, criminal robbery. 
                
            </p>

            <p class="two">
                
                AmeriKKKa has 
                normalized such a thing for decades, since the destruction of the indigenous Natives of this continent centuries ago 
                to its complicity in the 1948 Nakba of Palestinians and the ongoing, livestreamed genocide of the Palestinian people
                in our current day and age. The rhetoric of "Where is Pride in Palestinian?" in of itself confronts a lie. 
                They who ask such a question ask it from a base of capitalism, from the pinkwashing and whitewashing 
                of "Pride" as an inherent party, as if such an ideologue began with acceptance and joy and love. 
                The true essence of "Pride" is not the harem of drinks and nudity, of white faces collaborating with other white faces in 
                rainbow-colored drawers, of the newly-monopolized white Pride superimposed as all's "Pride". 


            </p>

            <p class="two">

                The actuation of Pride was never to impress upon those the physicality of the light spectrum onto 
                polyester-fiber flags, though said origins were to embody difference apart from the authoritarian state that is 
                America, AmeriKKKa, and its European reflection of the red, white, and blue colors. Pride is liberatory. It began 
                with anger, with America's tagline of their version of a pedophile, their version of a dissenter, of a heretic, of a criminal: the transgender woman.
                We've seen such taglines re-used prior to the self-actuation of the transgender woman when black folks fought for their own autonomy, 
                or the Jewish folk in Nazi Germany, co-sponsored by America in their complicit silence until it benefitted them to play the hero 
                (as we will see soon with the inevitable fall of the apartheid state of Israel, 
                like America, legitimized as a state by white faces and not the very indigenous who lived and live there).


            </p>

            <p class="two">

                Once, and silently still, the black man was the pedophile. The black man was the rapist of your white woman friend.
                The black man was sneaking into women's restrooms to assault them. This non-white, non-cis propaganda we once saw with the black man,
                the gay man, and, now, the transgender woman, was never about the safety of the masses but rather the dominance over those of perceivable dissent. 
                To be transgender is the ultimate form of dissent; we abscond ourselves of all societal appropriation and unweave ourselves into 
                communal versions of each other beneath the vanities brought to us by such empires. This ideologue was the penultimate form of pride, 
                of liberation, of the transgender women Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera's rejection of the classism superimposed onto them because of their 
                bodies and not for their true prowess, such women whose histories are forever admonished in respectful, appropriated language to 
                force this delusioned history that these women created "Pride" under peaceful pretenses rather than the pathos and anger that inspires 
                true rebellion. "Pride" is not a party, as such women have stated. Pride is not capitalistic joy. It is not your luxury car brand 
                accepting you or your nearby chain bank pretending they "see" you. It is not the local gay bar owned by a white straight man telliing you, "you matter". 
                Please. Don't make me laugh. Yes, there is no capitalist, white-faced, beer-ponged pride in Palestine. But there <i>is</i>
                Pride in Palestine. The pride in Palestine is the ultimate offensive weapon against the degrading walls of this empire 
                we have called "America" for centuries. This pride in Palestine is the 
                <a href="https://freedomflotilla.org/2025/06/01/a-month-after-conscience-attack-freedom-flotilla-ship-madleen-sets-sail-for-gaza/">
                Madleen sailing to Gaza to provide humanitarian aid against a forced starvation and genocide.</a> This pride in Palestine is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKmjvqhsoUg/">a mother holding her babe</a> as it succumbs to its 
                blast wounds from shrapnel by the apartheid entity naming itself "Israel". Pride in Palestine is resisting oppression. Pride in Palestine is children throwing rocks at 
                multi-armored tanks in the West Bank. Pride in Palestine is the rejection of apathy. It is the realization of oppression and the actuation of liberation. 
                Pride in Palestine exists throughout the entire region, through each of its peoples, through each cry and scream and laugh and prayer and moment of grief, however so short.
                It is refusing to accept the oppressor as one's ruler. Pride is in Palestine, and we must not forget it. We must not reject this truth.

                As 
                America utilizes the appropriation of the murder and genocide of black and brown peoples and trans and queer folks in Palestine, in Congo, in Sudan, it slowly enacts 
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKmhcGARmX7/">
                martial law to headbag brown-skinned, Spanish-speaking immigrants around the country to ready them for deportation and legalized slavery.</a> 
                This began decades ago with this flawed bicameral party system, with all the white presidents and single black president, because this 
                entire country is entirely dependent on having a consistent enemy to berate and destroy for the sake of distraction and diversion from the very crimes itself commits.
                Do not faulter. Do not give into the temptation of falling apart and giving up. This year's pride is not for ourselves but for the people of Palestine.
                This year's Pride is for the liberation of Palestine. WE MUST REMEMBER that the liberation of Palestine builds upon the liberation for us all. One's oppression is all of our oppression. 
                One's genocide and our complicity in their genocide begets our own. The people showed the American Government they did not care 
                an entire ethnic group was being genocided and ethnically cleansed, so the government took this response as dissonance and permission to 
                genocide its own ethnic groups. Trans people, Latinx people, black and brown immigrants, Muslims... it stops with Palestine. 
                It stops with their liberation. We must not stop. Prevail, my friends. Remind this empire you are not one, you are all. They win by 
                separating us, so lock arms. Your dissent is their fall. Your identity is their destruction. Your pride is Palestine's.

                Sometimes you tell yourself you deserve to be beaten, to be ridiculed and cast aside for being 
                submitted to the aphorism of beast, of animal, of a monster. You believe it to be true when a 
                friend---a supposed friend---tells you this because it is what you are, that a being of such unnature, of 
                a perceived artificialism, cannot be and mustn't be remotely close to that of a human being and therefore 
                deserves such treatment. You try, with recounted difficulty, to not believe such statements, so you cry to your 
                mother, a predetermined bastion of comfort in accordance to society. You expect her to empathize with your 
                melancholy, to reach for you in embrace, and tell you such words are untrue. But she doesn't. The very first time 
                you cry before your mother, truly cry, with a rancorous ardor full of the most confounding depression, she asks you, 
                "Was it your fault?"
            
            </p>

            <p class="two">

                Dearest mother, you wish to say, why do you propose such hateful things being said to me invites the idea that 
                fault is of my own. Why would I deserve such fault? Why should I? To the point of tears? To the point of the 
                rejection of the self and of life? Why, mother? Why would you say that?

            </p>

            <P class="two">

                When I think of all the friends I have lost, who no longer wish to be in my life, I ask myself, now, 
                if I am at fault for such things. Could I have done something differently? Been less of a ruckus, as they say.
                Less defiant. More tangible to their words. I tell myself it must have been me who led them all from my life. I 
                should have cried less. I shouldn't have transitioned. Oh, if I didn't transition, I tell myself, they would still 
                be here. None of this would have happened! I say. And you! You, my brother, if you just stayed alive and stayed in my 
                life, everything would have been okay! Absolutely, divinely, all right and okay. This, you see, you tell yourself. 
                You attempt to believe, wholeheartedly, that every fundamentally negative occurence in your life must have an explanation 
                and such explanation is derivitive of yours and solely your own actions. All because your mother prompted such an inquiry.

                I try not to be a bother anymore. I hide from my partner when I am depressed and wish to cry because, just once, he told 
                me he cannot handle all of my pain and such a phrase sprouted a parasitic interpretation that all forms of my own pain 
                must be struck in solitude and without his presence. Then, when your partner realizes you are in tears and somber, he 
                misinterprets your need to be alone, citing media as a means to calm yourself. You plead for him to leave you be. You tell 
                him you are unwell, that you wish to remain in silence, but such a thing is never truly understood now, is it? And, so, he 
                becomes offended by your agitation, by your asking of his quiet, of your want to simply sob to yourself, and he thinks he has 
                failed. He now beats himself for the interpreted failure of consoling his loved one. Now, you are at fault. You tell yourself, 
                why must you be so emotional? Why can't you just be fine? Stop being sick? Stop it! Stop crying! It's your fault, you shouldn't be crying! 
                He is the victim! Look at what you've done, you idiot! You tell yourself this! You tell yourself this over and over and over until 
                your words become garbled in the saliva and mucus filling your throat, the taffy-like strand of transparent snot hanging 
                from your nostril dropping onto your bare legs, spreading like clear paint, and you scream! Look what you've done, you tell yourself,
                Fuck, fuck, fuck! It's always your fault! So, you scream. You yell at yourself now through the tears. You slam your fist against the table or 
                floor, whatever's closer and harder to break, and your partner screams at you to stop. He's never screamed at you before, not like that. 
                Oh. Now you're scared because he screamed. Pathetic little thing. Look what you've done, you tell yourself. So you run away. Away into 
                whatever splotch of pitch-black darkness you may find to sob and beg for whoever comes to mind. Is it him? Is he who you ask for? 
                You can't even say his name aloud, you tell yourself, because you know, deep down, of how much he despises you. Why beg for someone 
                who hates you just by the mention of your name? So, you beg for your brother. You call him in that infantile nickname you made up as a toddler.
                You beg for him because you know not to beg for your mother for she will tell you it must have been your fault. But your brother doesn't respond, no,
                the darkness is entirely silent and mute, save for the draft carrying into the room from the moaning breeze outside through the crack of the garage door.
                Because he's dead. And you tell yourself it's all your fault.

                I asked my father tonight what our ethnicity exactly was, and what seemed like an impossible discovery 
                is now a concrete reality: we are Indian and Persian. The Indian threads stem from my grandmother who we, 
                meaning my cousins and I, would gently call "Ma" because of her tender approach to us with her sweet voice 
                and candy-like laugh, an adjacent exclamation to the West's <i>Santa Claus</i> yet better and infinitely realer.
                Ma passed away months after my grandfather Bapi (short for <i>Bapaji</i> because my
                cousin Alina trademarked the name when she was a toddler and was unable to fully pronounce the word, if my 
                memory permits me so)
                ---on my father's side---passed only a few short months after my 
                own brother did from, what I can remember, a strenuous blood swelling in his legs that caused such painful 
                burning throughout his body because of the inflammation. He lived a long life, and I wish he could've lived 
                indefinitely, as I believe the same for Ma. They died in their eighties. Ma, one may believe, died from the 
                undiagnosable fate of heartbreak mixed with the alchemy of dementia. I didn't get the chance to say goodbye to 
                Bapi, but I've always believed in reincarnation and its subtype of the afterlife. In a way, I have said goodbye 
                to him as I have said hello to the winds and the sun and the pulling waves. I did, however, say goodbye to Ma, 
                in a way, as a memory, as a reflection of someone she knew: my father. You see, I last saw her when in my 
                previous effigy, as a man, and she was there sorting through leaflets of magazines that she misinterpreted as 
                pictographs and video footage, pointing at a slim white model with perfect skin and telling me it was her and 
                Bapi at temple, when she was young and beautiful (though she was always a beauty to us). This was only months before 
                consuming my first pill of estrogen and testosterone's bane, Spironolactone, so I, weirdly, held a facade and likeness 
                to my father, masculinized. She kept calling me by his name, Zauher, and told me she was so proud of all I, my father, 
                had done in my, his, life. I saw the tears build in her glassy brown eyes, magnified behind her thick eyeglasses. She 
                was so perfect. So beautiful within her imagination. Bits of the present seeping through, yes, calling for Bapi, yet it was 
                a bittersweet grace, one may believe, for her mind's collapse to spare her from the tether of Bapi's passing. You see,
                I was not there to necessarily say goodbye to Ma, but for her to say goodbye to who she deemed fit for it. There was a 
                keen lesson there I learned at the age of twenty, of the boundless gift that is empathy, something that should be 
                so natural and subconscious like breathing or sleeping. You learn that you are not on this Earth for yourself but for others.
                For those within imagination and those outside of it. 

            </p>
            <p class="two">

                It makes me laugh amidst tears to think of her. My Aunty Tima once told me how similar Ma and my father were, 
                his portrayed stoicism a lie over the gentle caress of what he really is. Many misinterpreted him to be like Bapi, a man 
                with a more sturdy, stubborn approach to people, yet he was lovable nonetheless to his grandchildren. Admittedly, he was 
                tough on me, but it was deserved. I was a little spoiled shite. The reason my aunty said such a thing though is because it 
                is true. My father, quiet in comfort and reserved in space, is ultimately a kind man. I fell in love with classical music 
                because of him. He had a disc, I believe, he'd slot into his 2001 (I think that's the year) BMW SUV, and a lovely ensemble 
                of strings played in the vehicle as we drove on the weekends for his work either delivering vitamins to his patients or 
                going to his home. We were silent during the orchestra, yet we spoke along the tune, the soft chords and vibrating strings 
                surrounding our ears. Most of my mannerisms derive from my father, my preference in silence and small crowds and 
                the joy of quiet or reading and writing. My mother always saw me as an odd kid because I wasn't stereotypically "teenager",
                as in I didn't party or socialize much or drink alcohol like "the other kids". I was objectively the perfect kid, yet 
                my absence of wanting to sleep with women drove her over the edge in labelling me a sinner and malefactor of Satan, though we won't get into that 
                again.
            </p>

            <p class="two">

                As Ismaili Muslims we believe in reincarnation, though such a confounding ideology is like that of 
                linguistics, I believe. It is translatable. It is communicative. It is secular and non-secular. It is a version of one's 
                reality like Ma's magazines of models. Souls exist in all living things, no matter how small or obsolete one may perceive them to be, 
                and such souls have infinite purpose, a purpose to transport love from one being to another. We exist purely on the exactification of love.
                My father's love was the silence within classical music. Ma's love was her laugh. Bapi's laugh was his lessons in my own self-sufficiency. 
                My mother's, a reflection of the sins of her father. Love is never definitive, it can't be, it's impossible for it to be. It's relative 
                to the living attachment in one's life. Love is as infinite as the life of one's soul. We can love ourselves or love the many, and such a love 
                is still definable as love. I do not know you, dear reader, or, maybe, I do, and I will love you nonetheless. You may share such a love with me 
                or its antithesis, and I will still love you. You may have once told me to never speak to you again, us both in tears, over the phone, 
                with a promise to decide and reconsider ever speaking to me again, and no matter how much time passes, I will still love you all the same, infinitely more. 
                I love you as I love my partner. I love you like I love the souls of my brother, my grandmother, my grandfather. We exist on this temporary 
                plane of flesh not to waste time in disconnection but to value such limitations in love. In the rare permanence in sharing a hug or a kiss. In hearing 
                the other's voice. A laugh. The warmth of a hand. While I know my soul will transcend to another body after my passing, whenever that may be, 
                its current life, in my own, wishes to love. And if I never get that pleasure of hearing your laugh, your words flow out of those lips of yours, 
                then I believe we will meet again in the next life. Maybe we'll be birds next time, singing to each other. Maybe we'll be those microscopic bears named 
                "tardigrades" eating dead skin and floating in our own version of space, likely cannibalizing each other, as tardigrades do. Maybe you'll never see this. 
                It's likely you've flushed me from your memory. This is all for you, I admit. In case we never speak again.

                There is an ominous history on the deaths of writers. They never seem to ever find a perturbial happiness after
                finding their opus. There is a rumor that Edgar Allen Poe died after his last night of drinking at "The Horse You Came On"
                in Fells Point, his body found in a ditch covered in rainwater and, likely, passing sewage. This, though, 
                the drinking part, at least, seems to be, in fact, an acclaimed rumor by the owner of said pub, sourced by Jeff from 
                "History and Coffee", also in Fells Point. Tennessee Williams died from asphyxiation, though he had the privilege of living 
                until the young age of seventy-one with the critical and legendary acclaim of <i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i>. I had 
                studied the play in my undergrad under a Dr. Diecedue, and what I remember the most was Blanche's insecurity of her age and 
                using shadows to mask her supposed wrinkles.

            <p class="two">

                Who I find most curious is Sylvia Plath. She killed herself by carbon monoxide poisoning via head in the oven.
                She battled with depression most of her life, even having spawn before her suicide. When I write, I fear to admit 
                I do not write during spouts of happiness or joy. My writing is birthed from deep bouts of sadness and psychosis. 
                It comes to fruition by manic episodes, longing of memories of another life, and thoughts. Thoughts, well, likely 
                similar to Plath's. I do not have much to say this time. Humanity is parallel to monstrosity nowadays. Others 
                feign morality out of convenience. The people of Palestine have been enduring an ongoing genocide for 
                nineteen months. You once told me our lives were so similar, outside that Starbucks near home. I don't know how 
                long I can do this for. Pretending. Always pretending. Such theatre that I have forgotten how to remove the mask.

                Before my brother died he was dating a woman, who we shall call AK, and was madly in love with her. Or that 
                is how I perceived their relationship to be. I first met AK when I walked into our living room at the dusty age 
                of fifteen, two days without a shower, facial hair coarse, patchy, and smelling of dead skin and morbid 
                teenage-adjacent detritus in a fecal-stained blue boxer brief, and she was there, watching TV while working on 
                a project for her class as an elementary school teacher with colored markers and glitter glue on our second-hand 
                sectional, and I, still not having mastered social queues as a neurodivergent kid, thought this was 
                perfectly normal and not at all disrespectful to a guest in my mother's house. I had recently watched 
                season two, episode five of Nathan Fielder's <i>The Rehearsal</i>, and the convoluted, yet weirdly sensical, 
                connection between neurodivergence and airline maintenance fascinated me. I have never gone into 
                therapy for the direct diagnosis of autism, though I wonder if, possibly, I were to have spoken with a doctor 
                and their specialty that I may have indeed been told I am on the spectrum. I think it's safe to say I am, more 
                as a personal diagnosis given my mannerisms and hyperfixation on the actions of people and reacting precisely in 
                tandem with their own mannerisms rather than naturally. Fielder talked with a specialist, if my memory allows me,
                about neurodivergent people "masking" their true characters to provide comfort and relative normalcy for 
                non-neurodivergent people as a means to avoid confrontation from their own neurodivergence, something that is usually 
                done by neurodivergent people who do not meet the stereotypical standards of an autistic person. I understand 
                the hesitancy when one declares themselves as neurodivergent or autistic, a self-diagnosis, so have you. Still,
                it does give me my own sense of relative normalcy when looking back at my kid self, the attitudes, the reactions, 
                the inability to understand how to act amongst family members, new friends, adults who weren't my parents, and even 
                half-siblings who I had just met as a fifteen- or sixteen-year-old who called me weird or a loser because I mumbled 
                and paced around a wedding venue for an hour straight out of need to dissociate. Granted, I could have just been simply 
                odd. I could also just not be good with crowds and people. Or, maybe, I was never a people person. I do not have to be
                inherently autistic or neurodivergent to act similarly to people on the spectrum. To me, I feel it more appropriate to 
                receive a proper diagnosis from a professional before stating I myself am one on the spectrum. For all I know, I am
                simply insane. And that is okay!
            </p>

            <p class="two">
                For some time I called AK my sister, my family, both during her time with my brother and after his passing. 
                Growing up in a city and town where most of the people you communicated and interacted with were either people 
                who told you to act white---talk "proper" or dress with boat shoes, khaki shorts that stopped just above the knee,
                and golf shirts---or with people whose skin color matched my own but also fell under the same curse of 
                acting subservient and washing away any of their ancestral culture. Like myself, my closest and best friend did 
                not learn Spanish from our mothers. I cannot remember the exact reason as to why he didn't learn it, though given the fact his 
                Mexican mother still had a thick Latin accent, barely spoke any English, and married a white man who 
                left shortly after impregnating her with said best friend, I think it's safe to say it was for similar reasons 
                like my own: our mothers did not want us speaking cohesive Spanish around white people. It would, simply said, 
                make us look bad, in their eyes at least. I would tell my brother and AK many times growing up that I 
                "hate white people". I believe I meant it every time. As a brown-skinned youth with an Arabic name and 
                violently closeted I was not exactly treated well by the pale majority in my town. I, naturally, began to hate 
                my monsters. AK thought I was <i>joking</i> every time I said this. That says something, given AK was white-skinned 
                herself with what I presumed to be a common European and white name. A brown-skinned person hating their monsters was 
                something more realistically laughable than altruistic to her. After my brother died, we became reluctantly closer. 
                I was still closeted, though she secretly knew of my queer identity from my brother before he passed. She invited me 
                over to her mother's house for their Jewish passover one year, and I was happy to go there. I'm chuckling while 
                typing this, but I had just came from an Anytime Fitness with, I believe, an old friend helping me <i>get swole</i>, 
                as the kids say, and I arrived at her mother's house in a pair of black gym shorts, an oversized black graphic tee,
                and a trucker's hat with a comically animated sad donkey on it. It was indeed a full house: her mother with her chemically
                straightened black hair, AK slouching, eyes red and swollen as only a few months have passed at this point from my brother's 
                passing, and several members of their family. 
            </p>

            <p class="two">
                This is where memory becomes dodgy. The wondrous mystique of memory is that it acts on its own accord in infinitum. 
                We destroy what hurts us the most, especially in memory. I remember a bowl of matza ball soup, the homemade vegetable 
                stock floating doughy balls of unlevened flour seasoned with the perfect blend of thyme, pepper, salt, maybe some MSG, who knows.
                I told AK's childhood friend LU, let's call her LU, it was delicious, especially for a vegan dish. It was. It was amazing. I
                had thirds. I am thankful for the loss of memory in this moment and many more. As one becomes more aware of their surroundings, 
                they are forced to reckon with a past without information and supplement the absence with said newfound additions. You 
                recall pictures of your brother in Israel, before that great sand-colored wall of prayer, flexing his back with the tattooed 
                word "Familia" and his beloveds' names written beneath in Hebrew because AK told him how to spell your name in Hebrew. You 
                remember the photo of him surrounded by AK's family in "Israel", in their settler-colonial household that was likely stolen 
                by a Palestinian family. You remember all their smiles. How happy they looked. How happy he looked. You remember, and you 
                wish to absolve such memories. And it happens. You forget so much with pain. I sometimes forget the faces of friends I used 
                to have since childhood who I have not spoken to in years. Their faces appear in blur; their noses, mouths, eyes all a pale 
                splodge. Sometimes, I force myself to see pictures of them hidden in the cavity of social profiles or albums to remind myself 
                they ever even existed. I haven't seen AK's face in years, I believe. I struggle to visualize her now. I remember her long black straight hair. 
                She told me she got her nose pierced with a black hoop ring because the school would have likely fired her if she shaved her head in 
                commemoration of my brother and his buzzcut. After transitioning, I told AK one last time how much I hate white people. I couldn't tell you 
                the context, though it was likely valid. She called me a racist. Maybe she called me a Jew hater, too, by saying such a thing. This was 
                years ago, mind you, before my education of Palestine, though their plight remained all the same in that year, and the years before 
                when my brother was in "Israel" with her and decades before that. She told me, "Not all white people are the same". She held such an 
                adoration for my monsters and a distaste towards my own comment. <i>How dare you?</i>, she must have thought. I wonder if she is 
                holding such logic for the Palestinian people. I wonder, today, if she holds reason for the mass genocide occurring to tens if not hundreds 
                of thousands of Palestinian and Arabic and Muslim and trans and queer and black people alike who have, for centuries, been propagandized to the masses 
                to be vile animals and criminals and pedophiles and murderers. <i>They're not all the same</i>, I hope she is saying. Yet, I do not 
                believe in such a projection of humanity from her. No matter what I told her, my struggles were not her own.

                I was just eight when I first started playing Runescape, a massively multiplayer online role playing game 
                based in a medieval, fantasy universe full of dragons, demons, magic, gods, and rusted tractors from a bygone
                era---our past. I've always loved fantasy growing up as a kid, especially when it involved creating stories 
                from the infinite imagination of the child's mind. I first discovered Runescape at the local public library 
                when my mother was going to community college in the same area; she'd drop me off at the library, tell me to 
                go to the kids section (which had six box monitors and relative beige computers) and tell me to play. I think I'd 
                work on browser games, specifically Stick Wars, this versus game of stick figures from gold miners to stick giants against
                AI. 
            </p>

            <p class="two">
                I remember us growing up in poverty, my mother, brother and I. My father was, is, technically, a doctor,
                though he was reluctant in supporting us and rarely did. The only times he'd really part funds to us was when 
                my mother threatened to reveal to his mistresses he was cheating on each of them with the other. My mother officially
                left my father when I was eight. I had spent a night with him and his girlfriend, of who he was dating for years and 
                cheating on my mother with, at their condo in a wealthy part of Florida. I was using my dad's old Dell laptop to play
                Runescape, and I named my character "Lewewe1". My password? Well, my password was "Lewewe2". I was not the brightest
                child when it came to internet safety. I was doing a random event, of which at the time was not optional, where I had to
                save Molly by putting her evil twin sister in a schute. I got a DM (direct message for my older readers) in the game 
                from a person saying his brother was looking for a "newb" account. According to him, his brother had a maxed character, 
                level 123 to be exact, with high stats and an incredible bank. He said he'd happily give it to me if I gave him my account.
                I was ecstatic! I told him my password, and he actually didn't believe me. "Okay, be for real," he told me. <i>I am!</i> I 
                responded in text. It was clearly a scam, and I lost my first ever Runescape account at the ripe age of eight. That was my
                first lesson of deception.

            <p class="two">
                Telling a story is telling a lie. At least if it's fiction. My mom would bring me thrifted stuffed animals as a kid,
                and I'd create battlefields with them. I had a stuffed teddy bear and a stitched child with wool brown hair and white fabric skin 
                who'd act as their own generals. They each had their own respective battalion: my brother's beanie babies, action figures I ripped out 
                of my brother's pristine plastic boxes thinking they were meant to be open to play, and I'd use musical drumsticks as swords or staves,
                shaved-down pencils as wands or daggers or crossbows, and my mother's hoop earrings as tethers for the prisoners. I knew
                how to keep myself occupied during my mother's fights with my father. I'd became imbued in the dream of storytelling when 
                she screamed slurs about his dark brown skin and Muslim name, or when he retaliated with "bitch", "cunt", "Spanish whore",
                or use <i>sophisticated</i>words like "sycophant" against her knowing her inability to fully understand the English language 
                would frustrate her. Stories, in this sense, were a source of happiness.
            </p>

            <p class="two">
                I discovered Runescape from these two Asian brothers at the public library in the kids section. I couldn't tell you their names,
                I can just remember their faces. They spoke in Americanized accents and acted like the white kids who'd call me a "jihadist"
                when I began growing facial hair as a youth. The youngest of the two was ten, though he was in my grade because, according to him,
                "School ain't as fun as Runescape". The older one, I believe thirteen, was astute in Runescape technicalities, and he taught me the 
                basics until his younger brother took the reign. The youngest always asked me for my account details, telling me he'd 
                help level up my character whenever I wasn't at the library. There was a third player in their group, though, who wasn't present, 
                the oldest of their escapades, probably sixteen, who loved to see me cry. He was a fat boy riddled with acne over his rough white skin and 
                greasy black hair that flopped over his right eye like a botched <i>My Chemical Romance</i> cosplayer. The youngest brother 
                would give the oldest my account details for the purpose of the destruction of my account. He would then change my password, and the 
                youngest, who happily conspired with him, would tell me he had no idea how the man was able to get my account details. "Must've saw me type 
                it in!" he said with a crooked smile. I believed him, of course. I was just eight and had still not learned from giving away 
                Lewewe1 so easily. This was my second lesson in deception.
            </p>

            <p class="two">
                I was quite impressed with myself with the time I gave to Runescape, a game I still play frequently through its older variant
                named <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.com/" target="_blank"><i>Old School Runescape</i></a>. Just look at that pixelated, 2000s decorum of 
                the website. It reminds you of a simpler time. A time when your biggest hardships were of mom and dad screaming at each other, of 
                a time when the worst thing someone could do to you was hack your Runescape account and call you an idiot. A simpler time, yes.
                There are many moments in my current adult life when the simpler times come back to me. I think that's why I play this game, still.
                It allows me to get lost in a different world outside of our own. It let's me be free from the horrors of what is happening. 
                The absence of my father. The tears of my mother. The death of my brother. The disconnection from childhood friends. Runescape in 2008
                was a time of little fear and absolute fun. I miss such a time. I think this is why I write fantasy and science fiction. While 
                such worlds and universes I create are inspired by the real and my own, they are still a falsified extension of what is. They allow me 
                to escape the world we live in. It's not an original thing to say, I know, but it's true nonetheless. Sometimes, we need to pretend 
                what is in our life isn't real at all, and the worlds we embrace ourselves to enter are infinitely truer.

                I spoke with my oldest, closest friend yesterday. Him and I have been friends since we were twelve, and our friendship has grown into our own creed, a siblinghood, 
                an understanding of each other in the sense of familial bonds. I had the privilege and pleasure of being one of <a href="https://stoopstorytelling.com/" target="_blank"><i>Stoop Storytelling</i>'s</a> 
                <a href="https://stoopstorytelling.com/event/spoke-word-tales-from-the-bike-lane/" target="_blank">Spoke and Word: Tales from the Bike Lane"</a> storytellers
                this past Thursday. I told my friend I spoke of our childhood together, albeit briefly given the time constraint, but with a warming relishing that brought me to tears 
                over the video call with him. We don't see each other very often in person given the fact he is currently in Belgium for work and I in America. We actually don't speak 
                much either, though I do not wish for you, the reader, to perceive this as a monumental negative. My friend and I talk, usually over video, once every one to three months.
                Sometimes the reasons are of life and the inconvenience of distance. Other times it is the vagrant stupor of mental anguish that fills our minds from time to time. Yet he and 
                I never fail to speak when either of us need it the most. We rely on each other in our darkest or happiest times. We speak of what victories we achieved and the need to 
                share such moments with one another. The antithesis exists, too, naturally, as all forms of balance do. After telling him about my storytelling achievement---a personal 
                achievement, really---I cried. These tears were a mixture, an alchemy of the sadness of our loss of childhood and the profound happiness that we as peculiar children have grown 
                into brilliant people from our own hardships as brown people in a white, Conversative city in Florida.

            </p>

            <p class="two">
               It's a depressing humor thinking back on how we met. We were on the 8:20 AM school bus to our middle school, and my friend's route was before mine. The bus picked him 
               and every other black and brown schoolkid at the apartment complex they lived in on a stroad called Walsingham Rd. The complex had the definition of a facade: a well-manicured 
               painted exterior solely completed only in the most visible parts of the complex---the very front. Once one was to drive into the complex and past this facade, the complex 
               became what was its original composure when my friend and his family had moved there: uncared for. The road's potholes became torn apart, the flora ripped up and cast aside,
               and in the very back of the complex where my friend lived, the grass was dry, brittle, and within patches of the most coarse and textured dirt one may ever feel in their palms. 
               My friend will disagree when I say that he was not too fond of me upon our first meet in the bus. If I'll be entirely honest, he was in the right: I was a complete asshole and 
               an entitled annoyance. Still, we initially bonded out of our physicalities, our brown skin a difference from the majority of white kids at our school, and eventually became 
               brethren with each other, finding joy in anime, video games, and riding our teenage modes of transportation around the peninsula ten minutes west of us. The memories, naturally, 
               are blurred, though I can see us riding down the nude bike lane, me in my cheap bike where the spokes rattled every turn and the handlebars would creak and he on his longboard 
               that somehow rode over every crack and rock and sidewalk split without any fault or fear. We were simply kids. We had no fear of what was to come. We were given the rightful 
               privilege of not knowing the future and the horrors to come. Whether those horrors were interpreted as work, car-dependency, climate apocalypse, American terrorism, genocide on 
               indigenous peoples both now, in our childhood present, and the past before our first breaths, we did not know of such things. We were given the blessing and curse of blissful ignorance.
               And now, as my brain no longer grows and is halted for the rest of my life until it begins its ruthless decay, I see children on my miniature phone screen be genocided and killed 
               and exploded by experimental American and Israeli genocidal bombs and weaponry all under the vile illusion of freedom and liberation of white supremacy. We witness the 
               enactment of the horrifying "Gideon's Chariots" (of which I can't even find an appropriate citation because EVERY MEDIA OUTLET IS CONSTRUING THIS GENOCIDAL, ETHNIC CLEANSING OF 
               GAZA AND PALESTINE AS A "MILITARY OFFENSIVE") and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7786_0syBk&ab_channel=MiddleEastEye" target="_blank">the appropriation of murder and destruction onto Palestinian men, women, the elderly, and children,</a> which therefore grants admission 
               to destroy ANY ethnic minority and ALL minorities that trickle down the white supremacy ladder. I do not even know where to start about the ongoing genocide of other parts of Palestine, of Rafah, of the West Bank, because 
               the attention, naturally, is on Gaza. We are witnessing people of color, of Central America, of South America, of non-European descent be bagged over the 
               head and taken from the families by the Ku Klux Klan AKA the FBI, HSA, ICE. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/family-forced-keep-brain-dead-pregnant-woman-alive-rcna207002" target="_blank">We are watching a brain-dead black woman be experimented on as a bloody incubator!</a>
               All the while we witness white liberal democrats most poised efforts be reposting their support for disliking Donald J. Trump, or, most commonly, their entire silence on 
               the atrocities occuring. I am so frustrated. I am beyond anger because it is now undefined horror and sadness. If there is a god, he is no woman of melanin, for such an 
               abstract would not allow such a world to be manufactured by its creations. Our god that overseers and whips us into being is a white, soulless entity overjoyed by the 
               very machinations that mirror him. This new reich of America, the fourth and fifth and sixth and seventh, have all been in the making since the inception of empires and this one 
               in particular. I asked my friend, "When did you think you became radicalized?" and I struggle to remember his response. I struggle to remember my own. Were we radicalized before 
               our own thoughts could even be conceived because since our very births this country and world, from our very first breaths, began to discriminate us even as babbling, crying babies?
               Shame. Shame on these corporate and billionaire entities for what they are doing to our world and the very indigenous peoples who have maintained its survival for ages. Shame on 
               the very people, the black and brown and asian and non-white folk who participate in the willful silence and appropriation of this country's ineptitude and infidelity of 
               the most vulnerable and most broken. I hope to not see the day when the doom wreaks its slow and flaying madness onto our world. The parasites be damned.

                In American schooling we have grades and public school curriculum that is purposefully inferior to private schooling due to our classist and racist system. My
                second grade experience was one of mostly prejudice. My teacher at the time, Mrs. Gulf, was not too fond of me not because of who I was but by who she 
                associated me with: my brother. He was also her student when he was eight years old and in second grade. The first thing she told me was, "I hope you know what not to be". 
                It's a bizarre thing to tell a child of that age given the presumptions of such an age group in certain circumstances where we are told we do not know what we know, such as 
                sexuality apart from heterosexuality or gender apart from the given binary at birth, yet we automatically must know how to decipher our attitudes and interactions and verbalizations
                in public settings from our own family and cultures to grant comfort to the lady teacher named Mrs. Gulf. Mrs. Gulf was a big beautiful woman, a BBW as some may say, and she 
                had a son in my brother's grade, which was eighth, and she told me she didn't like the examples my brother set for her son. Odd. As far as I knew at that age, my brother's examples 
                were of rap, hanging with his black friends, and spouting about Fidel Castro. Remember, now, I was eight. These details mattered very little to me. I just wanted to go home and 
                eat my Ritz Cheddar Cheese Crackers and snack on my several Pizza Rolls and, maybe, one or two Hot Pockets if I were still hungry. When teachers and adults such as Mrs. Gulf 
                force such a weight of responsibility onto an eight-year-old, our worlds seem infinitely heavier thus forcing our psyche to equalize their priorities with our own. In other words, 
                food make me feel better.

                Two days ago was the forty-year remembrance of the 1985 MOVE bombing by the FBI and police department of Philadelphia. I am remiss to say the first time I heard about this 
                was just one or two years ago. America and its government finds so much joy in teaching their youth to hate themselves and hate the world because this very government 
                hates those who project happiness and unity and community. The MOVE family were black people of solidarity and liberation. And the terrorist American government and violent 
                police system who murdered and destroyed hundreds of lives and homes would rather you focus on fabricated "terrorism" and "criminals" from outside of the country and within 
                this one, too, as long as they are not white-skinned and wealthy. Once in second grade, a boy named Trey, with slicked-back gel-blonde hair, a tanned face with a single mole beneath 
                his nose, and southern Conservative parents---his mother the P.E. teacher and his father a businessman or lawyer, if I remember correctly---had cursed in the classroom one day. 
                He said, "Fuck" or "Shit", something perceived as derivitive by white folks. Mrs. Gulf, with her own fascination between my brother and I, asked who said the word after raising her
                head from her desk of papers and Blackberry phone. Well, Trey pointed at me, "[She] said it, Mrs. Gulf!" We're only eight, after all, the lesson of defending our neighbor and our 
                peer has yet to be taught. And, well, I was a quiet, a well-mannered child who didn't say much out of fear of getting in trouble. That didn't matter to Mrs. Gulf, you see. To her,
                the blood of my brother ran through my veins, and I was no different from him. She walked over to me, this tower of a BBW, and in an unfamiliar, dark voice, she said, "I know your 
                brother teaches you these words, but it doesn't give you any excuse to say them in my class." It didn't matter that I said it wasn't me. She had enough evidence from her prejudice to solidify I 
                did such an act. And so, I had to sit in the corner for the rest of the day, staring at the two collapsing walls and the black shadowed line that ran down between them.

                When I write, I've taught myself to write at least three drafts before deciding on a final product. Just recently, I began working on the second draft of <i>Bian Lian</i>
                and decided, after feedback from a professor, to both take her advice and change the trajectory of the story. Instead of the protagonist Alejandro being perceived as inherently 
                evil or abusive, he is flawed and stuck. Previously he raped a trans woman and gaslit his wife into thinking nothing is going on in the house when she is gone. Now, this edified
                trans woman, who still remains unnamed, has more humanity to her, and it to him. They are familiar with each other, dare I say in love, though she is, ultimately, a play thing
                for him, a temporance, and his wife will always be his at home, in their bed, waiting for him. To Alejandro, his wife is a safety, a luxury, that he knows will be able to have a future with.
                To many with this life, trans women are not meant to be true lovers but experiments of sexuality. Trans women, to this archetype, are not people. They are things. Toys. Pleasure pals.
                Dolls to play with, rip apart, and walk away from when you're bored.

	            I visited Florida these past several days for personal matters. The reasons of my doing so were positive and joyful to begin with,
	            though such an activity ended in exhaustion. Relativity made way to the realities that be, and my own personal reflection onto
	            this escapade was ultimately a negative one. Place has quite an impact on a person. It can turn them turbulent, wishing for a sporadic 
	            multitude onto all surrounding them, or create serenity, allowing them to find a new or familiar inner peace unbeknownst to them long ago.
	            For reasons of this being plastered onto a public, digital lexicon for strangers and friends to read, I will withhold the specifics. Although,
	            I feel it necessary to speak on the experience of returning to the place I once called home, to interacting with persons I once saw as equals
	            and who now perceive me as a lesser being either by the shade of my skin or the facade I hold truth to. 

            </p>

            <p class="two">

	            There was, at one point on my trip, where the breaking dam of thoughts and feelings made way onto the world of my own mania, but, alas, such things
	            have gone mute. I find myself on the topic of place, now, because I was made and unmade and made again within Florida. Florida, to me, is a violent,
	            wicked hellscape. It is a land of variety outside a singular majority. It is a world caged by mirrors and the silent screams of those most in suffering.
	            I did not want to re-visit Florida, no, if it were up to me I'd sooner be chain by a ceiling, a tether or noose clinging to my neck until the black
	            bruising left me in a violent gasp of undersea air. No, Florida and I were never companions. We were reluctant fellows in a parasitic relationship, 
	            Florida being the parasite and myself being the mad cow soon to writhe with disease.

            </p>

            <p class="two">

	            I had initially written more past the previous paragraph, but the laptop I wrote on had crashed and is now no longer serviceable. I will take such a thing as a sign.
	            I will, however, finish this note on this: my hatred for Florida is entirely subjective and connected to ill content. My mother, you see, has schizophrenia and violent episodes of psychosis. 
	            She relies on Christian faith not necessarily as a tool for growth and inflection but deflection. She hides her past with shades of religion and finds resolve in the arrogance of such
	            blissful ignorance. To this day, my mother refuses to accept my Muslim identity. She gets angry and begins to shout and scream if I dare say such a thing. She tells me
	            I was raised Christian and am Christian no matter the circumstance. It is an ironic thing given the fact when I began my transition she said something similar about
	            my being a man no matter what I attempted to change. The words may differ yet their meanings remain. I have come to realize I do not hate Florida, not objectively. It is a beautiful place with magnificent
	            flora, fauna, and cultures. Although, unfortunately, my mother loves it. And my subconscious acts as the antithesis of my mother's love. What she has come to love, I come to despise. She adores Florida.
	            She loves white people. She loves cars and the vain wealth they procure. She loves the beach and the burnt elderly tanning over their foldable chairs. She loves the children she substitutes for. 
	            She loves her lawyer who won millions in a wrongful death settlement for my brother. This latter fact she continues to pretend never happened, and she maintains this idea. How I know, well, she made the
	            mistake of giving me the same lawyer's number after my partner was hit by a car and needed counsel for his own legal settlement. After I began asking questions, well, she was quick to tell the lawyer to let us know she can
	            no longer help us and stopped answering my inquiries. 

            </p>

            <p class="two">

	            My mother is a flawed person. She grew up in poverty and raised my brother and I in it, too. We knew nothing but financial troubles and still made a life out of it. Her current wealth is of blood and grief, of the loss of
	            her favorite child and the remains of the bastard that brings her to tears because of her transition and feminine presentation. My mother does not wish for me to be a woman. She continues to urge me to dress
	            in a suit, wear my hair up and hidden, and to hide any and all forms of self-identity that I am entitled to. This is how she raised us. She raised us without identity. My mother does not identify as an Ecuadorian woman.
	            Rather, she claims herself as a Christian woman, as if the moniker itself is an ethnicity and culture. She raised my brother and I as Christian boys, and if anyone dared ask us of our backgrounds, she would say we came
	            from Europeans. She wanted so badly for us to be seen as a respectable white family when I was dark-skinned and Arabic named, and my brother was light-skinned with thick curls and spoke perfect Spanish. Yet, I hoped she 
	            had changed, somehow, to this very day. But I fear that is not the case. She asked me, after I tried so hard to tell her this world is one of racism and Islamophobia, why she hasn't suffered as I have? I don't know how
	            she managed to come to the conclusion that her and I are the same people. In some way, it explains a lot given her severe attachment to wanting me to spend every waking moment with her. So, I told her we aren't the same 
	            people. And it drove her mad hearing those words. I wish I could say why this verbalization of difference in identity created anguish in her, but I am not her therapist. It also saddens me to know she will never partake in
	            such mental medicine. Christ will always be her doctor, lover, facilitator, and mediator. I pray for the day she comes to her senses, though she has been given decades to come to. Inshallah.

            Yesterday, I received my nth job rejection out of around 300 or so applications in Baltimore. Today, I also had another rejection to a litmag due to the story not matching 
            the theme or tone of said magazine. The latter is understandable---my writing is not for the majority. It's usually violent and with many portents of body horror. I focus so much on the dark 
            aspects of life, whether it be of a city one lives in or their own physicality. Although, what some label as body horror I perceive as the real. Word choice defines a tone, yes, 
            but why something must be considered body horror when it's simply an existence of matter seen in a less lax version is confounding to me. One of my professors told me in his 
            response to my final portfolio that I revel in the grossness of detail, yet I should pay mind to the beauty of such things, too. Such feedback had me thinking of the truth in the comment. 
            I admit, I sometimes forget the beauty of <i>human</i> vanity, albeit I fail to find much of it. What makes a human beautiful is not inherently human rather the beauty surrounding them,
            or so I like to believe. Beauty is inspired by outward sources, from real beautiful subjects such as the pseudo-cerulean sea or the gradient petals of a flowerbush. Strip a human 
            nude, and the idea of beauty becomes falsified. That is why we adorn ourselves in jewelry, clothes, makeup. We are as beautiful as a newborn, though I write this adjective as a 
            derivitive rather than complementary. 

            </p>

            <p class="two">
                
                So, what does rejection have to do with this exhaustion of my feelings, my thoughts of the day. I tell myself such a concept is natural, as is the human body, 
                that it is expected like the sun rising and falling every day and night. Even though we expect such an occurrence, a predictable and common sort, it still has the 
                capacity to draw negative emotion, distress upon the mind, because ultimately such a transition of the sun's position or the rejection of another vocation may cause 
                turmoil to even the most capable of a schedule. Still, I sometimes wonder how such rejections can be so commonplace for me. Out of three hundred applications, only 
                two have responded for interview. Admittedly, one was willing to hire me, though the commute was an hour and a half, the pay almost seventeen an hour, and the expected work hours 
                would be sporadic with no compensation for travel or benefits. Desperation should not be cause for financial safety, though for some it is. It is not them who should be at 
                fault for such a mindset. This economy and its capitalist approach force it unto those willing to work to their bone for a sense of normalcy. The second went as far as an 
                interview. This was months ago, mind you, and the conversation went very well might I say. Alas, I was rejected. It was likely for the best. Two out of three-hundred, gods. 
                At some point, you wonder. You are qualified, sometimes overqualified, for the position you are interested in, yet there are countless rejections. There is so much to blame. 
                This excuse for a government. The dependency on artificial "intelligence" to filter through resumes---are they a man, a woman, is their name easy to pronounce to the American 
                settler or is it far too syllabic for the European tongue. And once they <i>do</i> feel compelled to look past such variables, there comes the background check and seeing 
                the peculiar legal name and gender change that came before your current, real moniker. Such a thing makes an employer ask themselves if hiring such a variable candidate is worth the time 
                and management. They believe we as transgender people are too difficult to employ, that we are debilitated because of our identity. Such thoughts are inherently ableist. And if by some chance 
                we do get hired, the employer expects us to be entirely grateful and willing to kneel before every bequest because they "did you a favor". My last vocation, my first week in working there 
                I was told, by the manager who hired me, that she chose me because I spoke Spanish and no other reason. She asked me, after being hired, if I knew the English alphabet and was 
                ecstatic when I wrote an affluent sentence within an email. It was a bizarre thing to be told by a white, blue-eyed lady with blonde-dyed hair and being a self-proclaimed liberal democrat. 
                Good for you, I say! Bravo! I will send an edible arrangement to congratulate your accomplishment. It's safe to say I was their diversity hire. It's Florida. A minority with my name 
                does not get hired for their skill in a white workplace rather for the presentation of their personhood. What they are when they're nude. The perceived beauty of what they wear; their name,
                their skin color, their accent or the languages they speak. 
            </p>

            <p class="two">
                I wonder what theme and tone the editor took from my submission of this litmag. Was it dark? Was it abhorrent? I was beautifying the common rat in Baltimore after it died beneath a cherry blossom 
                tree. I wonder, too, if my name causes friction amongst employers seeking a candidate for their team. Does my name strike discomfort amongst them? Activate a prejudice, mayhaps? The Arabic peoples are 
                being willfully genocided after all. It is no longer a blind, avoided occurrence. And such people hold beauty, even in death, do they not? They become martyrs in their blood. Their silence screams songs. 
                What the hell is beauty, then? What is beautiful and what is disgusting? I never understood such concepts. It's an entirely subjective thing to tell another to understand. My beauty is your disgust, and vice versa.
                The aged, weighing body, to me, is a magnificent thing, like the knotted, gnarled fur of a gray aged rat scurrying over cobbled streets. They are beautiful and wondrous to me. Yet, 
                to another, they are vastly disgusting. All this says about the opposing subjects is what their perspectives are onto people themselves, that the clothes that cover the beauty are what makes beauty. Such a sad 
                mentality. I feel sorry for such beings who hold such weight for the disembodied material.

                Admittedly, I did not do much today. I say this and realize I did, in fact, do something, at least, for the better of my health. That action is the 
                act of participating in therapy. I will not burden you with the details, for they are for myself and the tether of my thoughts. I began reading Richard Peaver's translation of 
                Mikhail Bulgakov's <i>The Master and Margarita</i>, and in his foreword he writes, "Once terror is identified with the world, it becomes invisible" (xix). It comes as no surprise
                when Peaver contextualizes this quote as this trope not being familiar to just the twentieth-century and the Soviet-censorship from it; the brevity of said quote holds true to centuries before, this very moment in geopolitical history, 
                and, likely, centuries beyond our own when we are merely scorched bone and dry dust from the inevitable doom of the toll our earth has taken from human infection. I'm not far 
                into the novel. In all honesty, I'm not much of a fast reader, my eyes dart between words on the pages and the world around me in most scenarios. Though, I find it easiest to 
                concentrate when within scattered noise, like a packed restaurant or a cafe where the espresso machine is constantly steaming milk. What a privilege it is to say this, the act 
                of concentration within confined, safe spaces. I feel so powerless at times, my perceived inability to <i>do</i> what I believe I think must be done placating a temporary depression 
                onto my soul when given myself brief moments of respite, away from my meager distractions of cycling or staring into a book. Maybe that in of itself is an act of exposing my own power.
                We aren't <i>truly</i> powerless, we have just been taught from very early ages that we are, regardless of our belief systems or identities. Such a mentality is the success of 
                capitalism, of the very reason why many of us and our immigrant mothers and fathers and parents have toiled the very American soil to create this ridiculous country into the apparent and real 
                fascist state it has been driven to become for many, many years. I will not say who told me this, not that it is new information or an original ideology, and I know I will not remember their words 
                verbatim, but resistance and the freedom of the oppressed from their oppressor does not come from sitting idly and without violence. Trans rights did not come to fruition by the lack 
                of a thrown object by a black trans woman, Marsha "Pay It No Mind" Johnson, rather by the actuation of it. We must remember this and cement such a history directly into our hearts and minds.

                <p class="two">

                    Today is another monetized, empty-hearted holiday where pseudo-culture participants with fair skin wear sombreros and eat their jarred salsa and packaged tortilla chips from the
                    chain grocery store to feel <i>enlightened</i>. Regardless, there is a more important, real culture being devasted and genocided that we must not lay our eyes from. Yesterday night
                    I had the privilege and pleasure of going to the <a href="https://www.2640space.net/" target="_blank">2640 Space</a> in Baltimore to watch the screening of <a href="https://www.watermelonpictures.com/films/the-encampments" target="_blank">The Encampments</a>
                    with fellow comrades and likeminded liberators. Words won't do it justice for how necessary this screening is to be viewed by all parties of the world,
                    especially those continuously avoiding such avenues of documentation of the genocide. For that, I will not summarize the screening but simply share that it
                    further educated my perspective on the cause and taught me more of the power of the student and the power of the oppressed and the power of the unified mind. 
                    What I'd like to take from it specifically is the common trope of the undeserved smile and happiness of the victim. This authoritarian idea where if we as liberators,
                    as protestors, are smiling and cheering for a cause we wholeheartedly believe in, such as the true liberation of an oppressed and genocided people from an apartheid entity, then we therefore
                    do not deserve to smile because we should be writhing in tears and pain and sorrow. The latter is true, still, within our hearts, though we do not survive for the others' sakes by drowning in sorrow
                    for that mentality ends in the ultimate victory of the powers that control our lives. Resorting to individualism, the idea that is <i>what can I, as a single person, do?</i> or 
                    <i>if it does not affect me, then I am safe from all manners</i> will end in the defeat of the people and the victory of the powerful. We must remember <a href="https://hmd.org.uk/resource/first-they-came-by-pastor-martin-niemoller/" target="_blank">
                    Pastor Martin Niemöller's "First They Came"</a>. We must use its poetic verses and reform it for every setting, whether it be for Palestinians, for trans people, for people of color, for service workers, for Africans, for South America, for the very people who suffer under 
                    the boots of the authority.
                </p>

                <p class="two">
                    I highly recommend reading <a href="https://www.mohammedelkurd.com/" target="_blank">Mohammed El-Kurd's</a> <a href="https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/2499-perfect-victims" target="_blank"><i>Perfect Victims and the Politics of Appeal</i></a> because it has the translatory ability of teaching
                    us the true infantilization of the victim to the masses; in other words, how do those in power, the media, the rich, make us believe in the comfort of witnessing the victim in their martyrdom. El-Kurd writes, "Resistance, in [the mainstream media's] case, meant something profane, 
                    disgraceful, not suitable for readers. Their victimhood was not a perfect victimhood, so they were not offered a spot in the <i>LA Times</i>" (El-Kurd 63). He then follows this by showcasing the "rightful" resistance 
                    of Ukranian rebel fighters in media outlets. I leave it to you, the reader, the understand why that is the case. As a Muslim trans woman who grew up
                    being perceived as an Arabic Muslim heterosexual man, my victimhood was nothing close to the genocide of Palestinians. Still, I experienced my own version of white American oppression in being called
                    a jihadist, a terrorist, a woman-raper (an irony given I was a closeted transgender woman with a massive attraction to men and masculinity), and when the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Orlando-shooting-of-2016" target="_blank">Pulse Nightclub Shooting</a>
                    occurred, these slurs and attacks on my person became even more seemingly justified in the agitators' eyes. Because of the massive lack of victimization for black and brown people, especially 
                    those of Arabic and Muslim demographics, me being a victim was not possible. El-Kurd writes similarly about the native never being entitled to such victimhoods because they were never portrayed as deserving of humanity:
                    "This misplaced focus insinuates that the oppressed must earn what they are already entitled to: liberty, dignity, and basic rights" (91). Before my transition, I came out, initially, as a gay
                    man. I wore feminine clothing, dresses, wigs, makeup, yet I did not feel sublime in my personhood. I was still belittled, attacked, berated, and talked down on in every avenue because of my new
                    persona. This applies to any portent of femininity, not just the homosexual Muslim man's or man-identified. Like skin color and language and culture in Palestine, femininity is the denunciation of patriarchal power.
                    It is the direct oppositionary force as well as the intertwined and necessary balancing force that curates the world we live in. Although, femininity is a grace, it is a beauty, it is the act of
                    freedom for the self that scares such a world built upon the white patriarchy. El-Kurd's <i>Perfect Victims</i> continues this parallel between the genocide and oppression of 
                    Palestinians and the oppression and vilification of many minority groups, especially immigrants of color and transgender people: "[Israel has] the tools to transform [myths of Palestinians being monsters] into a macabre reality, much like 
                    they have done in the besieged Gaza Strip. I only care about their dreams because they have taken them to the Knesset" (198). El-Kurd cites a <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XksJ_C2Kx80&ab_channel=MeltingPotMusic target="_blank">Kwame Ture quote</a> about the difference between wanting to lynch 
                    a black man and having the power to do so.
                </p>

                <p class="two">
                    So, what is the parallel I am bringing as an Arabic Muslim trans woman to the genocide of Palestine. The Palestinian cause and their liberation is the liberation for all under 
                    oppression---this is a cold and hard truth. The trans woman in America, in England, in the restroom and in the public space each fear for her lives as the authority that 
                    exists around us continues to vilify our womanhoods and force us into submissive fear. Remember the Pastor's quote. First, they came for trans people because we are an easy minority 
                    to target and subjugate. We are small, complex, free beings. We unmake the maker's mold onto our bodies and create our own version. We use our own versions of femininity, masculinity, the non-conforming to 
                    find bliss within ourselves. We destroy stereotypes with every second lived, every smile made, every laughter sprouted from the basins of our mouths. And that pisses the authority off. That 
                    angers the misogynist. It belittles their small views on the world, on women, on people of color, on queer folk, on everything that isn't white and a man.  Then, they came for the immigrants, those 
                    with a skin tone darker than fair with accents like the romance of sea water clashing into sand and bachata. They couldn't have done this without the media legitimizing the deportation of pro-Palestinian voices, an act 
                    that was planted long into the Biden presidency from his administration's constant leniency of the genocide. This capitalist country acts as if the two sides of its coins are different, but they are not. 
                    They serve the same purpose: to blind and stoke the flames of fear. We must abstain from the generalizations of the victim, of who we believe deserves to exist as a minority. I speak directly to you now. Maybe you 
                    hold prejudice for the Palestinian. Maybe you hold it for the feminine transgender woman of color. In my own experience, my laughter and smile has been responded negatively by those with white 
                    skin and being transgender and lesbian. The same people who grew into being perceived as white, heterosexual cis men with privilege and rich parents. Now, with their true identities as women,
                    they see my smiles as a direct attack onto their lives. I feel sorry for them, for you if that is who you are. Renounce those generalizations of what the perfect transgender woman victim is. We each deserve 
                    to smile and to love and to laugh however our lives see fit. And so do you. Do not strike me down because we are similar, but love me as I wish to love you. You are loved, dear one, with all the fibrous womanhood 
                    you deserve. You are loved. You are so loved. I love you.

                    We each deserve the right to smile, to dance beneath the blazing sun, jumping through cold water sprinklers over muddied grass. It is our right as thinking beings
                    to be granted moments of peace and serenity when many in power grit their teeth at even the thought of those in labor and service resting longer than the time given.
                    Today, I was enamored in happiness. I rode my bicycle to Bikemore's Bikepacking 101 Workshop early in the morn, beads of sweat falling onto my black camisole, shrunken 
                    gym shorts I wore riding up into my nethers. Still, even in my lackluster appearance, I found joy in going to the presentation. To me, riding a bicycle is like sipping
                    the creamiest drizzle of opium. It is like inhaling a long puff of marijuana, of herbal dopamine. While the event itself was concluding the wonders of bicycling through forests
                    and bear land, I was smiling, giddy, even, in the fact that I had just biked thirty long and heat-filled and sun-shined minutes to an event where likeminded bike-lovers were, too.

                    A member of my bicycling escapades, of my "bike fam"--or so I like to call them--was there, too. Out of respect for his identity, and my clearly radical politics potentially
                    troubling his professional life, I will refer to him as WOW. WOW planned on going to both the Mt. Vernon Flower Mart and the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/the_avam/?hl=en" target="_blank">American Visionary Art Museum's Kinetic Sculpture Race</a> around
                    Baltimore City. I'll be honest: the day was sublime. We rode through the mart, speaking to non-profits and pottery-artists and flower-lovers alike. I ate a $20 Indian food
                    combo, the server recognizing me from the day before, his kind voice and bright eyes a welcome sight from any person. We then rode to Patterson Park and met up with my two Anime friends
                    D & M, clapping and laughing along to each of the brilliantly defined and sculpted kinetic art riding through the trails. No matter how much the sun sunk into my body, exhausting every fiber of my
                    being, I could not help but cheer with all the other smiling faces within the event. It was a dream. It was a reminder of the love people have, the love of creation and each other.
                    A variety of persons were here, and each of them were held in the splendor riding before us. Gods. Today was a lovely day. We each deserve that moment. To be held within a lovely day, with each 
                    other, in love and in care.

                        A bird died in my hands today. It was a small, helpless creature I found on the sidewalk walking my dog, a sidewalk I rarely ever walk him over.
                        I needed to take a detour, the original sidewalk meters ahead of me sporting a dogwalker who seemed all too comfortable with her world. Its feathers were 
                        brown-spotted, its breathing frantic, and its toes---I feel remise calling them talons---were splayed outwards. It looked paralyzed. Its beak was planted on the 
                        warm cement ground, hidden beneath the shade of the giant tree's canopy above us. Its body was arched upwards, like it had been trying so badly to lift itself
                        without success. I couldn't feel its warmth. If anything, the lingering heat surrounding us was the warmth I felt, yet this bird felt like nothing. It was helpless,
                        and I felt useless in my inability to heal anything. I stroked its spine, expecting the worse, hoping for the best. I asked it to fly, to find something to push it
                        forward, but my words, English and indiscernible to their minds, did nothing. I felt like a child again, in her dreams wishing for a better world. I don't know how the babe got 
                        in such a position to die, how something that flies and sings beneath the blue sky it calls home was struck down to this pitiful cement sidewalk. A granular sidewalk,
                        hard and unnerving to my bare flesh when I knelt down to comfort its last breath. My dog, a natural idiot, mistook it as food, the smell of death and rot and garbage 
                        parallel to his kibble dinner. That says a lot of the kibble dinner he eats. He held the bird in his mouth for just a second, less than one I'd hope, before I screamed
                        for him to drop it. It happened so quickly, his jaw snapping over the babe, his simultaneous release of it, and the bird's beak was wide and open, silently screaming, its 
                        bosom heaving even more than before. We're in a gentrified residential neighborhood and no one is around us on this Friday morning. It's alive, but I believe its heart gave out 
                        after witnessing the darkness of a giant's maw. I was furious at the attempt by my dog, its idiocy and canine senses colluding all too successfully. It died in my
                        hands, its breathing becoming smoother, slower, mute. Birds just like it sang around us. They flew past our faces and its black-beady eyes were still. It didn't feel right to leave it on
                        the sidewalk, a place where giants crush the worlds hidden between the cracks. So, I rested the babe in a flowerbed beside us, tried my best to close its eyes without damaging it 
                        anymore than my dog did, and left.

                        Yesterday was May Day, and I marched for Palestine in Baltimore. I didn't feel it necessary to cover myself, my tattoos and facade all exposed, though it was mostly because
                        I felt it unnecessary at this point. I'm already unemployed, my personal information has long been exposed by all avenues becauses of our big brother government,
                        and I feel like the need to "cover yourself" and your entirety, to abscond any edifice of your person, is heavily predisposed by white privilege. It is white people
                        who ultimately have the choice to hide their beliefs and what they wear to discern their ideals. I can't do that. I'm already brown-skinned, opinionated, trans,
                        fat. I have discernible features, unlike most white people who are quite similar in taste and physicality. My comrade, of who she prefers to be unnamed (a pattern, you'll see),
                        is of the demographic who identifies with the marginalized. Yet, her white skin trumps over any sort of marginalization. White skin is one's prime safety. She 
                        participated in the march fully covered, her keffiyeh wrapped around her skull so only her eyes showed bits of excitement or draw. She pointed out my self-exposure. I 
                        told her she looks like every white person currently within the march. She wasn't the most in danger, Palestinians and people of color were. Yet, she felt the need 
                        to hide her visage as much as possible. She has no tattoos, no discernible features, and is blonde with rich parents. There is a pattern, you see, in the psyche of the 
                        privilege. Give them the flavor of oppression, and they see themselves as the ultimate martyrs.

            <h3 class="one">An Opine to Set the Air </h3>
            <h4 class="one">Thursday, May 1, 2025</h4>
            <p class="two">
                It took me the few several months I have been in Baltimore to realize I can
                write about my thoughts into the endless virtual void rather than ponder on them
                in my own cerebrum to the point of insanity. I have been unemployed, say, since January, since
                moving here, and it's been an interesting venture of nearly hundreds of applications
                to writing, communication, and legal jobs. There came this bleak realization,
                of which my partner rightfully tries to dismay me from, that because of my name, my gender,
                and my skin color, the probability of my finding work in the same relative spaces I used
                to work in Florida are likely quite low. In other words, being a Muslim, brown-skinned trans woman
                once again has its disadvantages, though such disadvantages never seemed to have disappeared ever, admittedly.
            </p>
            <p class="two">
                Still, writing becomes a salvation for my wellbeing once more, as it always has
                years before and now. I find myself deeper in the words I write, sinking into the digital ink over my
                laptop and questioning where such creativities have been hiding for so long. Yet within all of this
                neverending career searching and literary absolution, I have never been happier. Not contributing
                to the autocratic, oligarchic capitalist, racist, transphobic, xenophobic, genocidal oil-machine that is America and the American
                non-communal workforce has had its benefits to my emotional and mental psyche, but I must 
                emphasize the exponential importance and privilege that is of my moving from Florida to Baltimore. This place 
                is nothing like the Florida I was forced to exist in. For those who do not know, Florida, in its entirety, is inherently racist 
                and queerphobic. Some may argue with me, but the placation of one's white or pale skin holds massive benefits in such a place, like many around the world,
                and such a benefit is something I never had. I was called "white-passing" at one point, but such a phrase is ultimately
                relative, as not once was I ever recognized as "white" by those I'd have preferred to be seen as such: bigots and racists.
            </p>
            <p class="two">
                Baltimore has given me a sense of home and friends, two gravitous things that hold such value
                to the typical person. I've found identity not only in my transness, but through my Latinx and Arab-Indian
                identity. I see people who look like me, talk like me, have the same mannerisms of my aunties, mamaji, bapaji, uncles
                who all immigrated to Canada from India and the Middle East. Although, with all of these happy happenings,
                there were hardships along this journey. There were friends I still love who no longer are in my life,
                who wish to never see any image of me whatsoever. There are family members that are now strangers.
                Transition---whether it may be of one's gender or identity or of one location to another---is a heavy and restless journey.
                It is a realization that things and people are ultimately temporary. I think that's why I hold on so much to those
                I love, especially to those who will never love me again. There is temporance to life, and we must each
                use such limited time to care for another, regardless of the cracks between their bridges.
            </p>
            <p class="two">
                That's why I hold so strongly to the quote "Apathy is death". While my memory holds onto it
                from a video game, the phrase itself is deeply inspiring. To be apathetic is to kill oneself. It is to
                lose the one thing that keeps us parallel to the purity of other species. We humans are not the prime species. We are 
                violent, oppressive constructs. We aren't positively "separated" from natural things because of our sentience, rather our
                sentience is what maintains our savagery. Refuse apathy, I say, and love one another, even those who wish to
                never love you again. It is with that we break ourselves from the capitalist molds the authority has wanted us to believe for so long.
