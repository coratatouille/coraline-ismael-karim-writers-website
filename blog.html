                It took me the few several months I have been in Baltimore to realize I can
                write about my thoughts into the endless virtual void rather than ponder on them
                in my own cerebrum to the point of insanity. I have been unemployed, say, since January, since
                moving here, and it's been an interesting venture of nearly hundreds of applications
                to writing, communication, and legal jobs. There came this bleak realization,
                of which my partner rightfully tries to dismay me from, that because of my name, my gender,
                and my skin color, the probability of my finding work in the same relative spaces I used
                to work in Florida are likely quite low. In other words, being a Muslim, brown-skinned trans woman
                once again has its disadvantages, though such disadvantages never seemed to have disappeared ever, admittedly.

            <p class="two">
                Still, writing becomes a salvation for my wellbeing once more, as it always has
                years before and now. I find myself deeper in the words I write, sinking into the digital ink over my
                laptop and questioning where such creativities have been hiding for so long. Yet within all of this
                neverending career searching and literary absolution, I have never been happier. Not contributing
                to the autocratic, oligarchic capitalist, racist, transphobic, xenophobic, genocidal oil-machine that is America and the American
                non-communal workforce has had its benefits to my emotional and mental psyche, but I must 
                emphasize the exponential importance and privilege that is of my moving from Florida to Baltimore. This place 
                is nothing like the Florida I was forced to exist in. For those who do not know, Florida, in its entirety, is inherently racist 
                and queerphobic. Some may argue with me, but the placation of one's white or pale skin holds massive benefits in such a place, like many around the world,
                and such a benefit is something I never had. I was called "white-passing" at one point, but such a phrase is ultimately
                relative, as not once was I ever recognized as "white" by those I'd have preferred to be seen as such: bigots and racists.
            </p>
            <p class="two">
                Baltimore has given me a sense of home and friends, two gravitous things that hold such value
                to the typical person. I've found identity not only in my transness, but through my Latinx and Arab-Indian
                identity. I see people who look like me, talk like me, have the same mannerisms of my aunties, mamaji, bapaji, uncles
                who all immigrated to Canada from India and the Middle East. Although, with all of these happy happenings,
                there were hardships along this journey. There were friends I still love who no longer are in my life,
                who wish to never see any image of me whatsoever. There are family members that are now strangers.
                Transition---whether it may be of one's gender or identity or of one location to another---is a heavy and restless journey.
                It is a realization that things and people are ultimately temporary. I think that's why I hold on so much to those
                I love, especially to those who will never love me again. There is temporance to life, and we must each
                use such limited time to care for another, regardless of the cracks between their bridges.
            </p>
            <p class="two">
                That's why I hold so strongly to the quote "Apathy is death". While my memory holds onto it
                from a video game, the phrase itself is deeply inspiring. To be apathetic is to kill oneself. It is to
                lose the one thing that keeps us parallel to the purity of other species. We humans are not the prime species. We are 
                violent, oppressive constructs. We aren't positively "separated" from natural things because of our sentience, rather our
                sentience is what maintains our savagery. Refuse apathy, I say, and love one another, even those who wish to
                never love you again. It is with that we break ourselves from the capitalist molds the authority has wanted us to believe for so long.
