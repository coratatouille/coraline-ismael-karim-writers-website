            Yesterday, I received my nth job rejection out of around 300 or so applications in Baltimore. Today, I also had another rejection to a litmag due to the story not matching 
            the theme or tone of said magazine. The latter is understandable---my writing is not for the majority. It's usually violent and with many portents of body horror. I focus so much on the dark 
            aspects of life, whether it be of a city one lives in or their own physicality. Although, what some label as body horror I perceive as the real. Word choice defines a tone, yes, 
            but why something must be considered body horror when it's simply an existence of matter seen in a less lax version is confounding to me. One of my professors told me in his 
            response to my final portfolio that I revel in the grossness of detail, yet I should pay mind to the beauty of such things, too. Such feedback had me thinking of the truth in the comment. 
            I admit, I sometimes forget the beauty of <i>human</i> vanity, albeit I fail to find much of it. What makes a human beautiful is not inherently human rather the beauty surrounding them,
            or so I like to believe. Beauty is inspired by outward sources, from real beautiful subjects such as the pseudo-cerulean sea or the gradient petals of a flowerbush. Strip a human 
            nude, and the idea of beauty becomes falsified. That is why we adorn ourselves in jewelry, clothes, makeup. We are as beautiful as a newborn, though I write this adjective as a 
            derivitive rather than complementary. 

            </p>

            <p class="two">
                
                So, what does rejection have to do with this exhaustion of my feelings, my thoughts of the day. I tell myself such a concept is natural, as is the human body, 
                that it is expected like the sun rising and falling every day and night. Even though we expect such an occurrence, a predictable and common sort, it still has the 
                capacity to draw negative emotion, distress upon the mind, because ultimately such a transition of the sun's position or the rejection of another vocation may cause 
                turmoil to even the most capable of a schedule. Still, I sometimes wonder how such rejections can be so commonplace for me. Out of three hundred applications, only 
                two have responded for interview. Admittedly, one was willing to hire me, though the commute was an hour and a half, the pay almost seventeen an hour, and the expected work hours 
                would be sporadic with no compensation for travel or benefits. Desperation should not be cause for financial safety, though for some it is. It is not them who should be at 
                fault for such a mindset. This economy and its capitalist approach force it unto those willing to work to their bone for a sense of normalcy. The second went as far as an 
                interview. This was months ago, mind you, and the conversation went very well might I say. Alas, I was rejected. It was likely for the best. Two out of three-hundred, gods. 
                At some point, you wonder. You are qualified, sometimes overqualified, for the position you are interested in, yet there are countless rejections. There is so much to blame. 
                This excuse for a government. The dependency on artificial "intelligence" to filter through resumes---are they a man, a woman, is their name easy to pronounce to the American 
                settler or is it far too syllabic for the European tongue. And once they <i>do</i> feel compelled to look past such variables, there comes the background check and seeing 
                the peculiar legal name and gender change that came before your current, real moniker. Such a thing makes an employer ask themselves if hiring such a variable candidate is worth the time 
                and management. They believe we as transgender people are too difficult to employ, that we are debilitated because of our identity. Such thoughts are inherently ableist. And if by some chance 
                we do get hired, the employer expects us to be entirely grateful and willing to kneel before every bequest because they "did you a favor". My last vocation, my first week in working there 
                I was told, by the manager who hired me, that she chose me because I spoke Spanish and no other reason. She asked me, after being hired, if I knew the English alphabet and was 
                ecstatic when I wrote an affluent sentence within an email. It was a bizarre thing to be told by a white, blue-eyed lady with blonde-dyed hair and being a self-proclaimed liberal democrat. 
                Good for you, I say! Bravo! I will send an edible arrangement to congratulate your accomplishment. It's safe to say I was their diversity hire. It's Florida. A minority with my name 
                does not get hired for their skill in a white workplace rather for the presentation of their personhood. What they are when they're nude. The perceived beauty of what they wear; their name,
                their skin color, their accent or the languages they speak. 
            </p>

            <p class="two">
                I wonder what theme and tone the editor took from my submission of this litmag. Was it dark? Was it abhorrent? I was beautifying the common rat in Baltimore after it died beneath a cherry blossom 
                tree. I wonder, too, if my name causes friction amongst employers seeking a candidate for their team. Does my name strike discomfort amongst them? Activate a prejudice, mayhaps? The Arabic peoples are 
                being willfully genocided after all. It is no longer a blind, avoided occurrence. And such people hold beauty, even in death, do they not? They become martyrs in their blood. Their silence screams songs. 
                What the hell is beauty, then? What is beautiful and what is disgusting? I never understood such concepts. It's an entirely subjective thing to tell another to understand. My beauty is your disgust, and vice versa.
                The aged, weighing body, to me, is a magnificent thing, like the knotted, gnarled fur of a gray aged rat scurrying over cobbled streets. They are beautiful and wondrous to me. Yet, 
                to another, they are vastly disgusting. All this says about the opposing subjects is what their perspectives are onto people themselves, that the clothes that cover the beauty are what makes beauty. Such a sad 
                mentality. I feel sorry for such beings who hold such weight for the disembodied material.

                Admittedly, I did not do much today. I say this and realize I did, in fact, do something, at least, for the better of my health. That action is the 
                act of participating in therapy. I will not burden you with the details, for they are for myself and the tether of my thoughts. I began reading Richard Peaver's translation of 
                Mikhail Bulgakov's <i>The Master and Margarita</i>, and in his foreword he writes, "Once terror is identified with the world, it becomes invisible" (xix). It comes as no surprise
                when Peaver contextualizes this quote as this trope not being familiar to just the twentieth-century and the Soviet-censorship from it; the brevity of said quote holds true to centuries before, this very moment in geopolitical history, 
                and, likely, centuries beyond our own when we are merely scorched bone and dry dust from the inevitable doom of the toll our earth has taken from human infection. I'm not far 
                into the novel. In all honesty, I'm not much of a fast reader, my eyes dart between words on the pages and the world around me in most scenarios. Though, I find it easiest to 
                concentrate when within scattered noise, like a packed restaurant or a cafe where the espresso machine is constantly steaming milk. What a privilege it is to say this, the act 
                of concentration within confined, safe spaces. I feel so powerless at times, my perceived inability to <i>do</i> what I believe I think must be done placating a temporary depression 
                onto my soul when given myself brief moments of respite, away from my meager distractions of cycling or staring into a book. Maybe that in of itself is an act of exposing my own power.
                We aren't <i>truly</i> powerless, we have just been taught from very early ages that we are, regardless of our belief systems or identities. Such a mentality is the success of 
                capitalism, of the very reason why many of us and our immigrant mothers and fathers and parents have toiled the very American soil to create this ridiculous country into the apparent and real 
                fascist state it has been driven to become for many, many years. I will not say who told me this, not that it is new information or an original ideology, and I know I will not remember their words 
                verbatim, but resistance and the freedom of the oppressed from their oppressor does not come from sitting idly and without violence. Trans rights did not come to fruition by the lack 
                of a thrown object by a black trans woman, Marsha "Pay It No Mind" Johnson, rather by the actuation of it. We must remember this and cement such a history directly into our hearts and minds.

                    Today is another monetized, empty-hearted holiday where pseudo-culture participants with fair skin wear sombreros and eat their jarred salsa and packaged tortilla chips from the
                    chain grocery store to feel <i>enlightened</i>. Regardless, there is a more important, real culture being devasted and genocided that we must not lay our eyes from. Yesterday night
                    I had the privilege and pleasure of going to the <a href="https://www.2640space.net/" target="_blank">2640 Space</a> in Baltimore to watch the screening of <a href="https://www.watermelonpictures.com/films/the-encampments" target="_blank">The Encampments</a>
                    with fellow comrades and likeminded liberators. Words won't do it justice for how necessary this screening is to be viewed by all parties of the world,
                    especially those continuously avoiding such avenues of documentation of the genocide. For that, I will not summarize the screening but simply share that it
                    further educated my perspective on the cause and taught me more of the power of the student and the power of the oppressed and the power of the unified mind. 
                    What I'd like to take from it specifically is the common trope of the undeserved smile and happiness of the victim. This authoritarian idea where if we as liberators,
                    as protestors, are smiling and cheering for a cause we wholeheartedly believe in, such as the true liberation of an oppressed and genocided people from an apartheid entity, then we therefore
                    do not deserve to smile because we should be writhing in tears and pain and sorrow. The latter is true, still, within our hearts, though we do not survive for the others' sakes by drowning in sorrow
                    for that mentality ends in the ultimate victory of the powers that control our lives. Resorting to individualism, the idea that is <i>what can I, as a single person, do?</i> or 
                    <i>if it does not affect me, then I am safe from all manners</i> will end in the defeat of the people and the victory of the powerful. We must remember <a href="https://hmd.org.uk/resource/first-they-came-by-pastor-martin-niemoller/" target="_blank">
                    Pastor Martin Niemöller's "First They Came"</a>. We must use its poetic verses and reform it for every setting, whether it be for Palestinians, for trans people, for people of color, for service workers, for Africans, for South America, for the very people who suffer under 
                    the boots of the authority.
                </p>

                <p class="two">
                    I highly recommend reading <a href="https://www.mohammedelkurd.com/" target="_blank">Mohammed El-Kurd's</a> <a href="https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/2499-perfect-victims" target="_blank"><i>Perfect Victims and the Politics of Appeal</i></a> because it has the translatory ability of teaching
                    us the true infantilization of the victim to the masses; in other words, how do those in power, the media, the rich, make us believe in the comfort of witnessing the victim in their martyrdom. El-Kurd writes, "Resistance, in [the mainstream media's] case, meant something profane, 
                    disgraceful, not suitable for readers. Their victimhood was not a perfect victimhood, so they were not offered a spot in the <i>LA Times</i>" (El-Kurd 63). He then follows this by showcasing the "rightful" resistance 
                    of Ukranian rebel fighters in media outlets. I leave it to you, the reader, the understand why that is the case. As a Muslim trans woman who grew up
                    being perceived as an Arabic Muslim heterosexual man, my victimhood was nothing close to the genocide of Palestinians. Still, I experienced my own version of white American oppression in being called
                    a jihadist, a terrorist, a woman-raper (an irony given I was a closeted transgender woman with a massive attraction to men and masculinity), and when the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Orlando-shooting-of-2016" target="_blank">Pulse Nightclub Shooting</a>
                    occurred, these slurs and attacks on my person became even more seemingly justified in the agitators' eyes. Because of the massive lack of victimization for black and brown people, especially 
                    those of Arabic and Muslim demographics, me being a victim was not possible. El-Kurd writes similarly about the native never being entitled to such victimhoods because they were never portrayed as deserving of humanity:
                    "This misplaced focus insinuates that the oppressed must earn what they are already entitled to: liberty, dignity, and basic rights" (91). Before my transition, I came out, initially, as a gay
                    man. I wore feminine clothing, dresses, wigs, makeup, yet I did not feel sublime in my personhood. I was still belittled, attacked, berated, and talked down on in every avenue because of my new
                    persona. This applies to any portent of femininity, not just the homosexual Muslim man's or man-identified. Like skin color and language and culture in Palestine, femininity is the denunciation of patriarchal power.
                    It is the direct oppositionary force as well as the intertwined and necessary balancing force that curates the world we live in. Although, femininity is a grace, it is a beauty, it is the act of
                    freedom for the self that scares such a world built upon the white patriarchy. El-Kurd's <i>Perfect Victims</i> continues this parallel between the genocide and oppression of 
                    Palestinians and the oppression and vilification of many minority groups, especially immigrants of color and transgender people: "[Israel has] the tools to transform [myths of Palestinians being monsters] into a macabre reality, much like 
                    they have done in the besieged Gaza Strip. I only care about their dreams because they have taken them to the Knesset" (198). El-Kurd cites a <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XksJ_C2Kx80&ab_channel=MeltingPotMusic target="_blank">Kwame Ture quote</a> about the difference between wanting to lynch 
                    a black man and having the power to do so.
                </p>

                <p class="two">
                    So, what is the parallel I am bringing as an Arabic Muslim trans woman to the genocide of Palestine. The Palestinian cause and their liberation is the liberation for all under 
                    oppression---this is a cold and hard truth. The trans woman in America, in England, in the restroom and in the public space each fear for her lives as the authority that 
                    exists around us continues to vilify our womanhoods and force us into submissive fear. Remember the Pastor's quote. First, they came for trans people because we are an easy minority 
                    to target and subjugate. We are small, complex, free beings. We unmake the maker's mold onto our bodies and create our own version. We use our own versions of femininity, masculinity, the non-conforming to 
                    find bliss within ourselves. We destroy stereotypes with every second lived, every smile made, every laughter sprouted from the basins of our mouths. And that pisses the authority off. That 
                    angers the misogynist. It belittles their small views on the world, on women, on people of color, on queer folk, on everything that isn't white and a man.  Then, they came for the immigrants, those 
                    with a skin tone darker than fair with accents like the romance of sea water clashing into sand and bachata. They couldn't have done this without the media legitimizing the deportation of pro-Palestinian voices, an act 
                    that was planted long into the Biden presidency from his administration's constant leniency of the genocide. This capitalist country acts as if the two sides of its coins are different, but they are not. 
                    They serve the same purpose: to blind and stoke the flames of fear. We must abstain from the generalizations of the victim, of who we believe deserves to exist as a minority. I speak directly to you now. Maybe you 
                    hold prejudice for the Palestinian. Maybe you hold it for the feminine transgender woman of color. In my own experience, my laughter and smile has been responded negatively by those with white 
                    skin and being transgender and lesbian. The same people who grew into being perceived as white, heterosexual cis men with privilege and rich parents. Now, with their true identities as women,
                    they see my smiles as a direct attack onto their lives. I feel sorry for them, for you if that is who you are. Renounce those generalizations of what the perfect transgender woman victim is. We each deserve 
                    to smile and to love and to laugh however our lives see fit. And so do you. Do not strike me down because we are similar, but love me as I wish to love you. You are loved, dear one, with all the fibrous womanhood 
                    you deserve. You are loved. You are so loved. I love you.

                    We each deserve the right to smile, to dance beneath the blazing sun, jumping through cold water sprinklers over muddied grass. It is our right as thinking beings
                    to be granted moments of peace and serenity when many in power grit their teeth at even the thought of those in labor and service resting longer than the time given.
                    Today, I was enamored in happiness. I rode my bicycle to Bikemore's Bikepacking 101 Workshop early in the morn, beads of sweat falling onto my black camisole, shrunken 
                    gym shorts I wore riding up into my nethers. Still, even in my lackluster appearance, I found joy in going to the presentation. To me, riding a bicycle is like sipping
                    the creamiest drizzle of opium. It is like inhaling a long puff of marijuana, of herbal dopamine. While the event itself was concluding the wonders of bicycling through forests
                    and bear land, I was smiling, giddy, even, in the fact that I had just biked thirty long and heat-filled and sun-shined minutes to an event where likeminded bike-lovers were, too.

                <p class="two">
                    A member of my bicycling escapades, of my "bike fam"--or so I like to call them--was there, too. Out of respect for his identity, and my clearly radical politics potentially
                    troubling his professional life, I will refer to him as WOW. WOW planned on going to both the Mt. Vernon Flower Mart and the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/the_avam/?hl=en" target="_blank">American Visionary Art Museum's Kinetic Sculpture Race</a> around
                    Baltimore City. I'll be honest: the day was sublime. We rode through the mart, speaking to non-profits and pottery-artists and flower-lovers alike. I ate a $20 Indian food
                    combo, the server recognizing me from the day before, his kind voice and bright eyes a welcome sight from any person. We then rode to Patterson Park and met up with my two Anime friends
                    D & M, clapping and laughing along to each of the brilliantly defined and sculpted kinetic art riding through the trails. No matter how much the sun sunk into my body, exhausting every fiber of my
                    being, I could not help but cheer with all the other smiling faces within the event. It was a dream. It was a reminder of the love people have, the love of creation and each other.
                    A variety of persons were here, and each of them were held in the splendor riding before us. Gods. Today was a lovely day. We each deserve that moment. To be held within a lovely day, with each 
                    other, in love and in care.

                        A bird died in my hands today. It was a small, helpless creature I found on the sidewalk walking my dog, a sidewalk I rarely ever walk him over.
                        I needed to take a detour, the original sidewalk meters ahead of me sporting a dogwalker who seemed all too comfortable with her world. Its feathers were 
                        brown-spotted, its breathing frantic, and its toes---I feel remise calling them talons---were splayed outwards. It looked paralyzed. Its beak was planted on the 
                        warm cement ground, hidden beneath the shade of the giant tree's canopy above us. Its body was arched upwards, like it had been trying so badly to lift itself
                        without success. I couldn't feel its warmth. If anything, the lingering heat surrounding us was the warmth I felt, yet this bird felt like nothing. It was helpless,
                        and I felt useless in my inability to heal anything. I stroked its spine, expecting the worse, hoping for the best. I asked it to fly, to find something to push it
                        forward, but my words, English and indiscernible to their minds, did nothing. I felt like a child again, in her dreams wishing for a better world. I don't know how the babe got 
                        in such a position to die, how something that flies and sings beneath the blue sky it calls home was struck down to this pitiful cement sidewalk. A granular sidewalk,
                        hard and unnerving to my bare flesh when I knelt down to comfort its last breath. My dog, a natural idiot, mistook it as food, the smell of death and rot and garbage 
                        parallel to his kibble dinner. That says a lot of the kibble dinner he eats. He held the bird in his mouth for just a second, less than one I'd hope, before I screamed
                        for him to drop it. It happened so quickly, his jaw snapping over the babe, his simultaneous release of it, and the bird's beak was wide and open, silently screaming, its 
                        bosom heaving even more than before. We're in a gentrified residential neighborhood and no one is around us on this Friday morning. It's alive, but I believe its heart gave out 
                        after witnessing the darkness of a giant's maw. I was furious at the attempt by my dog, its idiocy and canine senses colluding all too successfully. It died in my
                        hands, its breathing becoming smoother, slower, mute. Birds just like it sang around us. They flew past our faces and its black-beady eyes were still. It didn't feel right to leave it on
                        the sidewalk, a place where giants crush the worlds hidden between the cracks. So, I rested the babe in a flowerbed beside us, tried my best to close its eyes without damaging it 
                        anymore than my dog did, and left.

                        Yesterday was May Day, and I marched for Palestine in Baltimore. I didn't feel it necessary to cover myself, my tattoos and facade all exposed, though it was mostly because
                        I felt it unnecessary at this point. I'm already unemployed, my personal information has long been exposed by all avenues becauses of our big brother government,
                        and I feel like the need to "cover yourself" and your entirety, to abscond any edifice of your person, is heavily predisposed by white privilege. It is white people
                        who ultimately have the choice to hide their beliefs and what they wear to discern their ideals. I can't do that. I'm already brown-skinned, opinionated, trans,
                        fat. I have discernible features, unlike most white people who are quite similar in taste and physicality. My comrade, of who she prefers to be unnamed (a pattern, you'll see),
                        is of the demographic who identifies with the marginalized. Yet, her white skin trumps over any sort of marginalization. White skin is one's prime safety. She 
                        participated in the march fully covered, her keffiyeh wrapped around her skull so only her eyes showed bits of excitement or draw. She pointed out my self-exposure. I 
                        told her she looks like every white person currently within the march. She wasn't the most in danger, Palestinians and people of color were. Yet, she felt the need 
                        to hide her visage as much as possible. She has no tattoos, no discernible features, and is blonde with rich parents. There is a pattern, you see, in the psyche of the 
                        privilege. Give them the flavor of oppression, and they see themselves as the ultimate martyrs.

            <h3 class="one">An Opine to Set the Air </h3>
            <h4 class="one">Thursday, May 1, 2025</h4>
            <p class="two">
                It took me the few several months I have been in Baltimore to realize I can
                write about my thoughts into the endless virtual void rather than ponder on them
                in my own cerebrum to the point of insanity. I have been unemployed, say, since January, since
                moving here, and it's been an interesting venture of nearly hundreds of applications
                to writing, communication, and legal jobs. There came this bleak realization,
                of which my partner rightfully tries to dismay me from, that because of my name, my gender,
                and my skin color, the probability of my finding work in the same relative spaces I used
                to work in Florida are likely quite low. In other words, being a Muslim, brown-skinned trans woman
                once again has its disadvantages, though such disadvantages never seemed to have disappeared ever, admittedly.
            </p>
            <p class="two">
                Still, writing becomes a salvation for my wellbeing once more, as it always has
                years before and now. I find myself deeper in the words I write, sinking into the digital ink over my
                laptop and questioning where such creativities have been hiding for so long. Yet within all of this
                neverending career searching and literary absolution, I have never been happier. Not contributing
                to the autocratic, oligarchic capitalist, racist, transphobic, xenophobic, genocidal oil-machine that is America and the American
                non-communal workforce has had its benefits to my emotional and mental psyche, but I must 
                emphasize the exponential importance and privilege that is of my moving from Florida to Baltimore. This place 
                is nothing like the Florida I was forced to exist in. For those who do not know, Florida, in its entirety, is inherently racist 
                and queerphobic. Some may argue with me, but the placation of one's white or pale skin holds massive benefits in such a place, like many around the world,
                and such a benefit is something I never had. I was called "white-passing" at one point, but such a phrase is ultimately
                relative, as not once was I ever recognized as "white" by those I'd have preferred to be seen as such: bigots and racists.
            </p>
            <p class="two">
                Baltimore has given me a sense of home and friends, two gravitous things that hold such value
                to the typical person. I've found identity not only in my transness, but through my Latinx and Arab-Indian
                identity. I see people who look like me, talk like me, have the same mannerisms of my aunties, mamaji, bapaji, uncles
                who all immigrated to Canada from India and the Middle East. Although, with all of these happy happenings,
                there were hardships along this journey. There were friends I still love who no longer are in my life,
                who wish to never see any image of me whatsoever. There are family members that are now strangers.
                Transition---whether it may be of one's gender or identity or of one location to another---is a heavy and restless journey.
                It is a realization that things and people are ultimately temporary. I think that's why I hold on so much to those
                I love, especially to those who will never love me again. There is temporance to life, and we must each
                use such limited time to care for another, regardless of the cracks between their bridges.
            </p>
            <p class="two">
                That's why I hold so strongly to the quote "Apathy is death". While my memory holds onto it
                from a video game, the phrase itself is deeply inspiring. To be apathetic is to kill oneself. It is to
                lose the one thing that keeps us parallel to the purity of other species. We humans are not the prime species. We are 
                violent, oppressive constructs. We aren't positively "separated" from natural things because of our sentience, rather our
                sentience is what maintains our savagery. Refuse apathy, I say, and love one another, even those who wish to
                never love you again. It is with that we break ourselves from the capitalist molds the authority has wanted us to believe for so long.
            </p>
