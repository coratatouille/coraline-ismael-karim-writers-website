            <p>
                This piece was recently accepted for publishing in the BULL litmag as of April 2025. 
                It it expected to be published in the four months following. The piece itself was written during a mini-workshop
                in my Contemporary American Writers grad class at John Hopkins University; it came out of a certain catharsis after a falling out with
                someone very close to me. The product that it is now portrays the grief I experienced in this happening, and the inevitability that is our
                permanent disconnection. I held onto a hope of this person returning into my life, though this piece finally being accepted for
                publishing acted as the sealant over my cracked heart. I hope it opens emotions for you, the reader, as it did for me. This was
                one of the few pieces I've written that maintains an emotional difficulty upon reread.

            <h4>University of Tampa's <i>Talon Review</i> Literary Magazine<br>2021 <i>Dreampiece</i> volume 2, issue 4</h4>
            <p>This story was written early in my transition, 
                almost a year after my first dosage, and I wanted to create a 
                reminiscing tale based off of a fictionalized yet real scenario 
                of my life. In a way, this piece is adjacent to the memoir, 
                written in blurred memory yet taken heavily from reality 
                and experience. I am hesitant to call it nonfiction as 
                some details may not be entirely true, though the story 
                itself is inherently real and so are the interactions 
                of my teenage years. Islam as an Ismaili Muslim has always been a positive in my life.
                I always felt welcomed amongst my Muslim family and, still, find love with my religious background.
                In an ironic way, the Islam I grew up, while binary, allowed a certain freedom I didn't have in the white cis Christian spaces
                I was forced to grow in.
